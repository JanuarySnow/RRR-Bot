The 8C is the name of the engine which had made Alfa Romeo famous for their technical excellence in the 1920&#39;s, that was designed by the famous Vittorio Jano. This was a famous and revolutionary 8 cylinder power unit that was not only used in the rad racing machines of the Alfas in that era, but also by many different manufacturers at the time. The front dashboard&#39;s classic looks brings to mind its background and has been applied to all models coming after the 8C as the new family trademark of Alfa Romeo. The very Alfa-esque emotional design is a major identifier, and the orders for the limited run of 500 cars worldwide was full almost as soon as it was announced. The car weighs 1575 kg and the weight distribution is slightly towards the rear at 49 to 51. To achieve this, the body combines a steel frame with carbon. Many aspects of the power unit is shared with Maserati, but Alfa Romeo has tuned its performance and sound. The 4.7L 444 HP V8 engine is matched with a trans-axle Q select 6 speed semi automatic. Alfa Romeo states that its exciting sound is compliant with all of the sound regulations set in various countries around the world. With a top speed of over 293 kmh and a 0-100 kmh acceleration of 4.7 seconds or less, its styling may be classic, but its performance is nothing short of a modern day super sports car.CHANGELOGv4.0 released 13.07.2020Physics- new aero- new power/torque figure- new suspensions setup- new suspensions geometry (from Kunos)- new tyres v10- revised inertia- corrected steer lock and ratio- corrected gear ratios- corrected differential settings- corrected fuel tank position- removed EDL- fixed autoshiftingVisual- new 3D model from GameModels.ru- added materials, shaders and textures from scratch- new textures thanks to cgbookcase.com and cc0textures.com- new 3D mesh for the third stop done scratch-made by RealAKP- Quadrifoglio Verde stickers scratch-made by RealAKP- corrected tyres and rims dimensions- corrected brake disks and calipers dimensions- removed unused stuff from 3D model- body AO texture made by RealAKP- welded vertex and unified normals by RealAKP- various UV mapping by RealAKP- reconfigured lights- adjusted graphics offset- regenerated VAO patch (CSP only)- new skins with OEM colorsOther changes- adjusted driver body and hands position by RealAKP- added CSP lights functionality- new collider kn5 file- adjusted collider position- new LODs kn5 files- reworked digital instruments- added differential locking options in setup screen- adjusted Pirelli PZero static pressure- new license plates numbers- revised onboard cameras- corrected fuel reserve light min liters- added skin template by RealAKP- updated ambient shadows- updated CM previews3.1 updated 22.03.2020- added v10 semislicks tyres- increased diffuser downforce- added EDL (electronic differential lock)- adjusted lights- tweaked onboard cameras- tweaked shaders- reworked skins interior- regenerated LOD files- skins with CSP materials- VAO patch (thanks to RealAKP)- PBR interior materials (CSP only)- exhaust smoke (CSP 0.1.47 or above only)- adjusted smart mirrors (CSP only)- fixed the steering texture bug3.0 updated 10.02.2020- new engine power/torque config- corrected engine limiter- reworked aero (ACCR v2)- adjusted suspension setup- tweaked differential settings- fixed downshift protection- adjusted force feedback multiplier- tweaked shaders- updated ambient shadows- regenerated LOD files- updated previews2.0.4 unreleased 01.02.2020- tweaked shaders2.0.3 unreleased 26.04.2019- lowered car (graphics)- adjusted carpaint shaderv2.0.2 addon 19.04.2019- interior AO addon by RealAKP- slightly increased car body reflectionsv2.0.1 hotfix 17.04.2019- added back street tyres- removed semislick tyre typev2.0 updated 16.04.2019- new aero (ACCR v2)- updated LODs .kn5 files- replaced sound with Alfa Giulia- tweaked suspensions setup- slightly changed car inertia- reduced steer ratio- new differential- increased downshift time- removed clutch pedal functionality- added downshift protection- engine limiter corrected- added brake bias option in setup- little changes on electronics devices- removed street tyre type- textures optimizations by RealAKP- new calipers with AO by Real AKP- updated skins with baked AO map by RealAKP- updated Content Manager previews- moved config file into main folder structure- fixed hands and steering wheel out of synchv1.5 updated 18.12.2018- added LODs .kn5 files for better performance- tweaked OEM setup- implemented tyres extended ray-tracingv1.4.2 updated 30.10.2018- changed default tyres to semislicksv1.4.1 updated 29.10.2018- tweaked suspensionsv1.4 updated 18.10.2018- new tyres v10- new cameras- updated aero- tweaked shaders- adjusted lightsv1.3.2 updated 10.09.2018- corrected car fuel consumptionv1.3.1 updated 26.08.2018- tweaked car setup- adjusted digital instruments intensity- adjusted force feedback strengthnessv1.3 updated 25.08.2018- added digital instruments- enlighted digital gauge- tweaked suspensions- adjusted car body reflections- adjusted tyres shaderv1.2.1 updated 18.08.2018- adjusted car internal shadersv1.2 updated 26.07.2018- adjusted differentialv1.1 updated 23.07.2018- adjusted suspensions- tweaked power/torque figure- bug fixedv1.0 released 22.07.2018- initial release",

        "description": "The mid-engined Chaparrals, built from 1963 through 1970, are among the most iconic sports-racing cars ever built, up there with vehicles such as the Ford GT40, Ferrari 330P4, and Porsche 917. The cars are significant for a number of reasons. First, they were cutting edge. Chaparral founder Jim Hall pioneered aerodynamic developments such as wings and ground effects, as well as alternative forms of construction.      Hall&#39;s small operation out of Midland, Texas, was also one of the most successful American competitors in international motorsports, taking on and beating the established sports-car makers from Europe. For example, in 1964 and &#39;65, Chaparral won 11 of 16 races in the SCCA&#39;s U.S. Road Racing Championship, the precursor to the SCCA Canadian-American Challenge (or Can-Am) series. The Chaparral 2 and 2C also won 11 other major races in that period, including the 1965 12 Hours of Sebring.     The 2E was brilliantly conceived. The wing was mounted high to get the cleanest airflow possible and set at a 17-to-18-degree angle to generate 240 pounds of rear downforce at 100 mph. According to Hall, that angle could be flattened to four or five degrees, depending on the racetrack.     The radiators and the oil tank were repositioned at the back of the car to get as much weight as possible over the tail. Hall: 'That was all done probably because we were Texans. We wanted to eliminate heat (by moving the radiator from in front of the driver), and that gave us the freedom to do what we wanted aerodynamically at the front. And we also wanted better traction.' The air that would have flowed into the radiator at the nose was used as a venturi tunnel to create additional downforce.      ",

        "description": "1972 Ferrari 312PB SpA Ferrari SEFACThe racing debut of the engine was made in a 312 B Formula 1 racer. The &#39;B&#39; represented the Forghieri V12 engine, though it was not a boxer engine. The Ferrari engine rested in an aluminum semi-monocoque, similar to the F1 car. In other words, it was basically a full body Formula One car. It had a five-speed gearbox, vented disc brakes, and weighed around 660 kilograms. The 460 horsepower engine was mounted mid-ship and sent power to the rear wheels.The 312PB made its inaugural debut at the Brands Hatch 1000km race in April of 1971. The car was immediately competitive and proved its potential by finishing second behind an Alfa Romeo 33/3. This would be one of the few highlights for the car during the 1971 season. For 1972, things shifted in Ferrari&#39;s favor, as FIA rule changes abandoned the 5-liter sports car class. Only the 3-liter prototypes were able to run in the World Sports Car Championship. During the 1971 season, and during the offseason, the car was continually modified and its shortcomings were identified and fixed. Horsepower was increased from an initial 450 to 460. Experimentations and testing were done with aerodynamics resulting in a very refined racer. Next, Ferrari worked on the cockpit, specifically the driver&#39;s selection. They hired the best and most talented drivers such as Brian Redman, Arthuro Merzario, Jacky Ickx, Tim Schenken, Mario Andretti and Ronny Peterson to help guarantee another manufacture&#39;s championship.",

        "description": "On the track Ferrari&#39;s dominance was as big as ever both in the prototype and GT class, but across the Atlantic Ocean a scheme was designed to break the Scuderia&#39;s stronghold. At first Henry Ford tried to buy Ferrari, but when negotiations failed, Ford set out to design a car that could beat those &#39;fast little red cars&#39; as he called them. With the Lola Mk 6 as base, the Ford GT made its debut at the 1964 24 Hours of Le Mans.Now fitted with a four litre engine, the 330 P proved both quicker and more reliable than the little tested Ford GT. With no Fords finishing, Ferrari scored an impressive 1-2-3. In the GT-class Ford scored a first success by beating the GTOs with the AC Cobra Daytona Coupe. No expense was spared on either side of the ocean and Ferrari wheeled out the new P2 which would face Ford&#39;s 7-litre GT40.After 560 test laps at Daytona in December 1966, the P4 was ready for action. Two of the three P3s were fitted with P4 style bodywork and a Weber carbureted engine. Two unfinished 330 P3s were built up to the same specifications and dubbed 412 P. All four cars were sold to privateers, to back up the factory P4 effort. New from Ford at the 1967 24 hours of Le Mans was the Mk IV version of the GT40, featuring an American built aluminium-honeycomb monocoque and the familiar 7 litre V8.All the testing at Daytona paid off as Ferrari dominated on Ford&#39;s home soil in the Daytona 24 hours race. The podium was filled by Ferrari drivers which underlined the Scuderia&#39;s dominance when the three winning cars crossed the line together. The first two were P4s and the third a P3.",

        "description": "Ford GT40 MKIVPerhaps the most significant post-war American race car ever produced was Fords Mk IV GT40, and it is nothing short of a racing legend. It was the ultimate development of the GT40 platform, and it took the fight straight to Ferrari, dominating a field that included the Ferrari 330 PF and the Chaparral 2F, as well as its predecessors, the GT40 Mk I and Mk IIB. As history would reveal, the Mk IV would only be campaigned in two races, at the 1967 12 Hours of Sebring, where Mario Andretti and Bruce McLaren piloted a Mk IV to victory, and at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, where Dan Gurney and A.J. Foyt outperformed all to the checkered flag and won the Index of Performance for the most efficient car. That victory is the only all-American outright win of an American-built chassis, engine, team, and drivers at the fabled Le Mans 24-hour endurance race. Due to the Mk IVs unparalleled performance, the FIA quickly relegated the Mk IV to racing extinction by outlawing any prototype car that had larger than three-liter motors.",

        "description": "Of the 1,580 original RS&#39;s built, only 55 became the RSR 2.8 race cars. For racing, the Porsche factory introduced code M491, the Renn Sport Rennen (RSR). Porsche took 55 RSH body shells off the line before the engines and transmissions had been \ufb01tted and moved them down to a separate factory called Werk 1. This was Porsche\u2019s racing shop and they chose this line to ensure an extremely high standard of preparation for their racing clients. The 2.8 RSR looks different from a standard 2.7 RS because of its massive fender flares, central oil-cooler air intake, &#39;duck-tail&#39; wing and ultra-wide Fuchs wheels. While the wider wheels and arches combined with the low air dam to give the RSR a much more aggressive look, the conversion process was much more than just a bunch of tweaks, it was a serious engineering exercise. The car was wider by two inches and the arches were \ufb02ared to the maximum permitted by the sporting rules, all to allow big 11 inch rear and 9 inch front wheels. The brakes were based on 917 components, with huge axially and radially drilled discs and \ufb01nned four-piston calipers. Porsche engineers also developed revised suspension settings and added more adjustability to help with race setup. They lowered the car and all the rubber was taken out of the suspension joints.Weight-saving was a key focus and Porsche was able to cut 176 lbs from the already light standard RS Lightweight. That was harder than it sounds because Porsche also strengthened the RSR\u2019s chassis in three key areas at the rear of the car to cope with the increased demands and speeds placed upon it. Inside, weight was taken away from everything. The interior had a bare metal \ufb02oor, minor bits of felt trim and a rubber mat, framed by a lightened roll cage. About the only notable things inside were a leather cord to open the door and a 10,000 rpm rev counter.&#39;When it was done, the RSR stood as the lightest, fastest, most powerful and most agile 911 ever to enter GT racing and the model immediately proved its worth in racing. The car won the \ufb01rst round of the 1973 Work Championship for Makes. It then followed up by capturing wins at the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, Targa Florio, and six of nine rounds in the 1973 European GT Championship.Many 2.8 RSRs, were later uprated with RSR 3.0 liter engines, wich is also the case in this mod.",

The racer did feature considerably wider wheel arches, a full-width front spoiler, which also housed the oil-cooler and the now legendary &#39;whale-tail&#39; rear wing. For safety reasons and also adding to the structural rigidity was a full roll-cage constructed from aluminium tubing. The most significant change was the adoption of coil springs for the RSR 3.0, instead of the torsion bars used on previous 911 versions. Mounted underneath the sizeable rear wing was the Type 911/75 flat six. Equipped with twin-spark ignition, the 3-litre engine produced around 315 bhp.",

In its first year out, the CSL won the 1973 ETCC and BMW was then motivated to go further with their program.  Over the winter, an all new engine known as the M49 was developed with a DOHC setup and 24 valves for the 1974 season. It was increased to 3.5 litres and modified into the M49/2 for Lemans.",

        "description": "Ralph Broad\u2019s Southam, Warwickshire, based racing team had excelled in touring car competition since the early 1960s, running Ford Anglias, Mini-Coopers and Triumph Dolomites. Ralph Broad believed the competition potential of the Jaguar V12 engine. Leyland subsequently contracted Broadspeed to prepare a Group 2 Jaguar XJ12 to confront BMW and Ford in the European Touring Car Championship.The XJ12 Coupe was larger and heavier than its German rivals. An heroic development period from October 1975 saw two cars built for the 1976 racing programme, of which this is the second, chassis number \u2018BELJC002\u2019.The newly-constituted Broadspeed Jaguar team missed the first five rounds of the 1976 Championship series for which their big, beautiful XJ12Cs were intended, and the programme did not make its race debut until September that year, in the RAC Tourist Trophy race at Silverstone. There in qualifying, Derek Bell lapped at 1 min 36.72secs, which was nearly two seconds faster than European Champion-elect Pierre Dieudonn&#233; in the fastest BMW. Bell led the opening stages of the race until tyre wear became a factor and a puncture interrupted the car\u2019s race. Thereafter the Broadspeed Jaguar XJ12C ran spectacularly until co-driver David Hobbs had a driveshaft break and lost a wheel.\u2018The Big Cat\u2019s presence at the TT had been a great spectator attraction, and a full two-car team presence in the 1977 ETC series was then planned. They were driven by John Fitzpatrick, Tim Schenken, Derek Bell and Andy Rouse. The programme\u2019s swansong followed in the 1977 TT at Silverstone for which the two Broadspeed XJ12Cs filled the front row of the starting grid and Schenken led from Rouse at flagfall. The Rouse/Bell car eventually finished fourth.Principal racing modifications to the robustly-built Jaguar Coupe included provision of massive AP brakes cooled by special ducts for all four corners and specially cast suspension components to cope with racing loads. The interior, while stripped and now featuring just one bucket seat, actually retained its walnut veneer dash and electric windows, possibly unique features for a racing car!",

        "description": "Motor racing success has often proven to be a very powerful marketing tool, so it came as no surprise that Ford announced a racing program soon after the launch of the all new Capri in 1969. In 1971 the Capri RS was the car to beat in the European Touring Car Championship and it was beaten only once. Jochen Mass took the driver&#39;s title, but it was Alfa Romeo who campaigned in a smaller class, that took the manufacturer&#39;s title. More competition was expected in 1972 from the newly founded BMW Motorsport team. Driving force behind the new team was Jochen Neerpasch, who had left Ford after the first race of 1972.For the 1974 season the sport&#39;s governing body allowed DOHC heads to be fitted, of which only 100 examples had to be produced. With the help of Cosworth the new 3.4 litre quad-cam V6 engine was developed in 1973. The engine and heads were homologated by a short production run of the Capri RS 3100. Another big modification was the move of the radiators from the nose to the rear wheel arches for weight balance purposes. Performance of the revised Capri increased by quite a bit, with the engine pumping out around 440 - 450 bhp at around mid-season.",

        "description": "One of the first competition outings for the L88 Corvette was the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June of 1967. Driven by Bob Bondurant and Dick Guldstrand, the potent machine reached speeds of up to 171 mph but was eventually forced to retire with a broken engine. With the introduction of the C3 in 1968, true racing success came for the L88 Corvettes. In that year&#39;s SCCA A-Production class, a big-block Corvette would win eight races out of eleven attempts. The L88 Corvettes would remain successful for several more seasons, scoring outright wins on the American continent and also numerous class victories in international events.For 1969 an even hotter RPO was added to the Corvette option book. Known as the ZL1, this included an all-aluminium version of the big block, which was also used in the popular Can-Am Challenge. Only around a dozen were built and reportedly just two were sold as the engine alone was just expensive as a complete small-block Corvette. Due to the high compression, the L88 could only run on 103 octane fuel, while the other competition components did not make it particularly suited to road. Experienced racing teams knew very well how to tweak the engine for full performance, like replacing the very restrictive exhaust headers. Later tests showed that the V8 was actually capable of producing in excess of 560 bhp.",

        "description": "The Ferrari 365 GBT/4 was bestowed with the same racing DNA as its predecessors, so it was only a matter of time before one was independently prepared for racing. Not surprisingly, among the first to field a Daytona was Luigi Chinetti, who was Ferrari&#39;s American importer and long time private entrant under the North American Racing Team (NART) banner. Readied in 1969, the alloy-bodied NART Daytona was raced at Daytona and Sebring with a twelfth at the latter as the best result.Buoyed by the performance of his Daytona, Chinetti approached Enzo Ferrari in an attempt to re-consider his decision not to make a competition version. He met his old friend halfway and offered the help of the &#39;Assistenza Clienti&#39; or customer assistance department to ready a batch of five new cars for the 1971 season. Built to Group 4 regulations, the new &#39;Daytona Competizione&#39; featured an all-aluminium body with plastic windows. This helped shave a massive 400 kg off the dry weight of the relatively heavy road car. Further changes to the exterior included the removal of the bumpers and the addition of small &#39;fences&#39; on the the front wings to improve stability at high speed. In 1973 a final batch of 5 Daytona Competiziones was produced with slightly improved engines raising the power output to 450bhp. The result was another class win at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.",

Hako (\u30cf\u30b3) means Box in Japanese, and suka\uff08\u30b9\u30ab\uff09 means Skyline (\u30b9\u30ab\u30a4\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3; Sukairain). The GT-R began as a sedan, but a 2-door coupe version was introduced in March of 1971. The cars were stripped of unnecessary equipment to be as light as possible for racing, and the cars performed well at the track. The sedan racked up 33 victories in less than two years, and the coupe stretched this to 50 through 1972.The KPGC-10\u2019s main circuit rival was the Mazda RX-3. By mid-1972 the RX-3 had surpassed the GT-R, ending the winning streak. The GT-R was also a favorite of reckless street racers who roamed the streets at night at that time.It is claimed that the art of drifting began among Japanese racers when they purposely engaged their emergency brakes as a way to counter understeer on their GT-Rs. One such driver who was known for this was the Drift King Keiichi Tsuchiya.To enable racing with it&#39;s AC Legends competitors, this version of the Skyline 2000 is equiped with a turbo engine delivering 417Nm @ 4000 rpm @ 1 bar of boost pressure. Maximum power is 452hp at 8000rpm.",

        "description": "With Alejandro De Tomaso&#39;s deeply ingrained love for racing, it was no surprise when a competizione Pantera was unveiled in late 1971. Built to contest the FIA&#39;s now legendary Group 4 category, it would most notably go up against factory-built race cars from Ferrari, Porsche and Chevrolet. The starting point was a lightweight Tipo 874A chassis, almost every part of which had been extensively drilled. This was equipped with shorter suspension uprights, solid bronze bushes and adjustable Koni shock absorbers. Ride-height was thus totally variable as were the larger diameter anti-roll bars front and rear.While a projected weight of around 1100kg had originally been targeted, Porsche were so concerned about the Pantera&#39;s arrival that they forced the FIA into homologating the Group 4 version (or GT4) at 1250kg. To overcome this, the car needed a race-spec engine of the highest order. It was eventually decided that Bud Moore-prepared Boss 351 motors would be flown over and installed at Modena. Although De Tomaso quoted around 500bhp for these engines, early cars were typically producing around 440bhp at 7000rpm. This was soon upped to 470bhp for the 1972 Le Mans race.",

To enter the racing class &#39;Group 4&#39; Porsche needed to build 50 race cars within a year according to the rules. This gave us in 1966 the Porsche 906, also referred to as the Porsche Carrera 6.The Porsche 906 was to be the last legal road going Porsche Race Car until the 1996-98 Porsche GT1.Lotus suspension components were used and street legal 15 inch wheels were fitted, but their 5-bolt design didn\u2019t help when needing to change tires during a race.Sculpted for the first time in a wind tunnel, the Porsche 906 had a more rakish and Sport Prototype shape than the 904 GTS. The headlights were still plexiglass covered, but the whole front-end and its chiseled air-intake appeared flatter and lower than the 904, which also provided downforce on the front axle.Also in 1966 Porsche started to build nine 906 Prototypes to enter in &#39;Group 6 Prototype&#39; Class as Factory cars and were named Porsche 906 E, meaning &#39;Einspritzung&#39; or &#39;Injection&#39;. These prototypes had an early Bosch Fuel Injection system that when tuned to its best produced up to 220 hp at 8100 rpm giving a 280 km/h / 174 mph top speed on the Mulsanne Straight.",

All the design work was done by eye and used no aides like a wind-tunnel. The final result was far from conventional combining an elegant round nose with a steeply raked windshield and a &#39;cut-off&#39; rear end. The first Cobra Coupe was completed early in 1964 and extensively tested at the nearby Riverside track. The testing revealed that although somewhat unusual, Brock&#39;s design worked remarkably well. Miles clocked a 183 mph top speeds, beating the original Cobra Roadster by 20 mph. In the hands of Dan Gurney and Bob Bondurant, it was quick enough to upset the order and clinch the GT-class win and fourth overall. It was the first time that Ferrari had not won the GT at Le Mans, since it was established in 1959.",

        "description": "At the end of the 1969 season, Lola's Eric Broadley realised the Group 5 T70 Coupe was no match for the might of Porsche and Ferrari, so instead he switched his attention to the two-litre Group 6 class. This was quickly gaining interest and for 1970 a European Sportscar Championship was established especially for these prototypes.Lola offered the T290 without an engine, leaving customers to pick their power-plant of choice. Cosworth was the preferred engine supplier and for the 1972 they offered two options; the venerable FVC or the newly developed Chevrolet Vega based 'four'. The former was tried and tested but displaced only 1,790 cc while the latter was not quite as reliable. Some teams did develop larger versions of the FVC while Cosworth themselves were hard at work to create the two-litre BDG. Regardless of the engine choice, a Hewland five-speed gearbox was used.The successes of the T212 during the 1971 season, had certainly increased the demand for Lolas and no fewer than 34 T290s were built in 1972. Many were sold through European representative Jo Bonnier, who also fielded some of the cars with works support. Especially the Vega engined cars were quick straight out of the box but the engine's poor reliability proved a real handicap. As a result, the Abarth-Osella team and driver Arturo Merzario won the European Championship. The T290s were nevertheless very successful, winning races and championships all around the world.250+ hp, 2.0 Liter overhead-valve Cosworth 4cyl engine with Lucas fuel injection, five-speed Hewland FG500 manual transaxle, independent front and rear suspension with Bilstein dampers and coil springs, and four-wheel disc brakes.",

        "description": "The first of the T70 family of racing cars was created in 1965 by Eric Broadley who founded Lola Cars. It was designed after he had left the Ford design team who were working on the GT 40. Ford had decided in 1962 to 'win Le Mans' and having failed to buy Ferrari, had resorted to designing their own car. At the time Eric Broadley had just designed the Ford Fairlane engined Lola GT, a car which in one step introduced almost all of the design features of Sports Racing cars ever since, e.g. monocoque construction, mid engine etc... He was therefore invited to design what was to become the Ford GT 40. After some time on the project he left because he felt that the design had become 'design by committee' and that was therefore being pulled in too many directions, particularly towards becoming a heavier production car. The T70 was nearer to what he intended the Ford to be plus the results of some lessons learned from the GT 40's behaviour on the Mulsanne straight at Le Mans. The striking rear body shape of the T 70 stemmed from the attempt to remove the lift which made the original GT 40 a 'white knuckle ride' down the Mulsanne. Having observed that the very successful T70 spyder (it won the American Can-Am series) did not suffer from lift over the rear body, he introduced a similar flat rear deck on the coupe version, to such good effect that instead of 300 kg of lift as in the GT 40, it in fact generated 200 kg of down force. Broadley thus introduced the concept of trading drag for down force (at the time the shape was misunderstood by some who criticised its drag, which was inevitably higher than other GT cars of the period, which were, as was normal then designed for minimum drag. The Lola T70 was therefore well suited to tracks with fast sweeping bends such as Spa, where the trade off of drag for down force meant that it could take corners flat which other cars had to lift for. The T70 was not very successful at endurance racing such as Le Mans, due mostly to lack of a competitive engine. The racing small block Chevy of the period was developed for the high octane fuels then available in the USA, and did not thrive on European fuel. However it achieved considerable success in shorter races such as the BOAC 500 where its good handling and light weight made it very competitive.",

The design of the M1B was evolved the by artist Michael Turner, working with Tyler Alexander and Robin Herd. It had a blunter noise and sharper cut off at the tail. Design work by Robin Herd saw the M1B gaining a 20% stiffer chassis than the M1A, and the M1B was no heavier. For the first Can-Am series in 1966 it became obvious to team McLaren early in the season that their 5-litre Traco-Oldsmobile were going to be no match for the 6-litre Chevrolet. After the opening races in Canada, Bruce switched from the aluminium engine to the cast iron 5.4-litre Chevrolet which weighed 200lbs more, but gave an extra 100 horsepower.The works car driven by McLaren and Amon competed in the 1966 Can-Am series powered by the 6-litre Chevrolet V-8 with Hilborn injection.",

In total fifteen were produced, mainly for use in the Can-Am series and its European equivalent, the Interserie.  Similar in appearance to its works predecessors, the M8C could be easily distinguished from the M8B by the fact that its rear wing was much lower down and mounted to the chassis (elevated, suspension-mounted wings had been banned following the 1969 Can-Am season).  Unlike its older siblings the M8C\u2019s aluminum monocoque chassis did not use the engine as a stressed member, which allowed customers to choose between Ford and Chevrolet engines (this particular car employs a 650-bhp, 7.0-liter Chevy unit that can take it to 60 mph in 2.7 seconds -- and to a top speed of 205 mph). Although the M8C proved competitive in both the 1970 and 1971 Can-Am seasons, however, it was no match for its works M8D and M8F rivals.",

        "description": "Porsche first revealed the 917 to the press at the 1969 Geneva Motorshow. This was followed by an intense CSI homologation inspection, demanding that all the cars needed to be complete before the car could race. Remarkably, Porsche produced eight more cars in three weeks to complete the necessary 25 cars. On April 1st, 1969 the 917 was homologated just in time for Le Mans.During initial tests, the 917 was found to be particularly unstable and many driver\u2019s began to have doubts about its design. Brain Redman said &#39;it was incredibly unstable, using all the road at speed.&#39; It was thought that the engine might be too powerful for the chassis and the much less powerful 908 was preferred by the factory drivers. At the 1000km of Spa, a long tail 908 was chosen in favor over the 917.For the 1970 season, 917s were sold to Martini Racing, JWA Gulf Racing and Porsche Salzburg\u2014all private teams that would be supported by the factory. Under the direction of John Wyer, the engineers at JWA tackled the handling problems first discovered in testing. Wyer\u2019s engineer, John Horsmann, came up with a solution to hack off the rear section of the bodywork and replace it with a new aluminum section. This greatly improved stability by increasing downforce at the expense of drag. Porsche later made revised tail sections for most of the cars and called the cars Kurzheck or 917K.",

        "description": "After shaving close to 250 pounds from their 1967 'lightweight' Camaro, a rule-defying modification that prompted pre-race inspections the following season, the Penske team undertook a different series of alterations for their 1968 cars. While the prior season\u2019s lightweight Camaro was briefly used at the beginning of the 1968 season, a new more heavy-duty car was concurrently engineered to withstand the rigors of the season\u2019s two endurance races, the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring.Starting with an all-new 1968 body shell, Penske engineer Ron Fournier integrated spherical suspension rod-ends, stronger motor mounts, and aircraft-grade fasteners into the chassis. Despite complaints about their weight-shaving techniques, Penske once again acid-dipped the body and then re-added weight in particular areas of the car to improve its overall balance. A dual four-barrel Cross Ram intake manifold was installed on the 302\u2013cubic inch Traco-tuned Chevy engine. Donahue went on to write, 'it was so much faster than the single four (barrel set-up) that we reckoned it was another Unfair Advantage.'",

        "description": "In 1969, the Sunoco-sponsored Roger Penske Camaro with the legendary Mark Donohue as the top driver repeated their previous domination of Trans Am racing by winning another eighteen out of twenty-five races. It took first place at Michigan International, Bridgehampton, Bryar Motorsports Park, Mont-Tremblant, Watkins Glen, Laguna Seca, Sears Point and Riverside during the 1969 racing season.Several modifications had to be made to the Camaro before it became the championship Trans-Am racer that made the Camaro nameplate into a road-racing legend. The most predominant of these was the acid-dipping process in which the Z28 undertook before being delivered to Roger Penske. Acid-dipping on race car bodies was a common practice for the time, and the purpose of dipping a car body in acid was to lower overall mass while maintaining the car\u2019s strength and rigidity.Other track-oriented modifications to the Z28 included air channels built-into the doors for increased airflow to the rear brakes, quick-release brake pads and a custom-lube system in which oil could be added to the engine once it reached racing temperatures. All of these modifications are primitive, or so they seem, but the Penske team was the only one at that time who was using them, which allowed Penske to be more competitive than any other racing team at Trans-Am, winning more professional races at an increasingly-faster rate.",

Wrapped in a sleek and racy package with a more European flair, Z/28s now looked more sophisticated than in the past. Thanks to the new SCCA rule allowing base motors to be reduced, the street version's displacement grew along with increased power and performance. The new slippery body along with hundreds of man-hours in aerodynamic testing and development meant the Z/28 would have a leg up in Trans-Am. At the end of the 1969 Trans-Am season Rodger Penske announced that he would be switching from the Chevrolet Camaro to the AMC Javelin for the 1970 championship.Chevy turned to long time partner, Jim Hall's Chaparral Cars of Midland, TX, to take over the factory entry for the Camaro. Chaparral had been the key in Chevrolet's Can-Am or Group 7 operations for years, creating some of the most innovative racecars ever seen.Hall built three new chassis for the 1970 season for himself and Ed Leslie. Vic Elford. Joe Leonard would also drive for the team that season. #1 is one of the three team cars built, and the only one known to still exist.The team was very competitive finishing in the top ten every race and taking one victory at Watkins Glenn with Vic Elford at the wheel.

While Dodge came late to the SCCA Trans-Am series, by time it got started management was already having second thoughts. While the team was well experienced, they were too nose-heavy. The Challenger T/A's just couldn't compete on the road courses of Trans-Am with the heavier weight and less dynamic handling than it's cross town competition. Posey finished fourth overall for the 1970 season. Overall, the Challengers had good success in the 1970 T/A Series, finishing 'in the points' in six out of eleven races.

Also on hand were the team's primary drivers, Dan Gurney and Parnelli Jones. At Moore's shop, Mercury's biggest race was already under way: To prepare three SCCA-legal Trans Am cars in time for the 300-mile season opener at Daytona International Speedway's road course on February 3. The second and third cars started out as off-the-line production sedans intended to be built with the 390 GT package; big-block Cougars had beefier front-end components, such as control arms, that would be beneficial in Trans-Am racing, even though the series' maximum displacement limit was 305 cubic inches. All three cars were raced during the 1967 season. While two Cougars were entered in every Trans-Am event, all three cars were entered at Sebring and reportedly at the Marlboro 300 in Maryland. As for David's car, its season record first saw Ed Leslie, another Moore team driver, finish fifth overall at Sebring's four-hour Trans-Am round after both Jones and Gurney fell out. At Marlboro, engine problems prevented the prototype from qualifying. It next showed up at Crow's Landing in Modesto, California, a former Navy air base, where Leslie started and finished sixth. Renumbered 15, it then showed up for Round 10 at Riverside International Raceway, where NASCAR star David Pearson would drive it to its only Trans-Am win after starting from the outside pole. At the penultimate event at Stardust International Raceway in Las Vegas, a youthful Peter Revson, the future international star who also started several races for Moore that year, was gridded seventh in David's car but was DNFed in 19th.",

        "description": "The Plymouth Barracuda started life as a youth oriented compact car. Although the earlier Barracudas competed in SCCA racing, it wasn't until 1970 that Chrysler dove in head first with the AAR Cuda version of it's all-new body style. Named after Dan Gurney's famous All American Racers, the production AAR Cuda used a high-performance tri-power 340 motor with a choice of automatic or 4-speed trans. Standard gearing was 3.55 or optional 3.91, both with posi-traction 'Sure-Grip'. A standard matte-black fiberglass hood with Ram-Air, rally rims and rear spoiler were added to mimic the Trans-Am SCCA racecar. Heavier and less nimble than the other SCCA PonyCars, the AAR cuda was geared more towards muscle car than pony car. What it lacked in agility it made up for in aggressive styling and brutish straight line performance.",

        "description": "In 1966, Dodge offered buyers a performance-enhanced version of its Dart, built specifically for D Stock drag racing. With a little bit of work, a few enterprising road racers discovered that these cars were competitive in the SCCA\u2019s new Trans-American Sedan Championship series, and a few D-Darts were converted to go fast in other than a straight line, running alongside their more conventional Dart brethren. A mere 50 Dodge D-Darts were built in total, and only a handful were ever run in the SCCA\u2019s Trans Am series.  The Dart\u2019s moment in the Trans-Am sun was short-lived. Despite the model\u2019s two wins in 1966, Ford took the championship that season and followed up with a second championship in 1967. The following year, 1968, the Chevrolet Camaro was the car to beat, and by that time, Dodge was out of the running for the Trans-Am manufacturer\u2019s championship.",

        "description": "The Pontiac Firebird was released five months after the Chevrolet Camaro, and offered buyers choices of six and eight cylinder engines. Pontiac was able to use that additional time to create a unique identity for the Firebird, despite having to use the Camaro chassis and some body panels. Despite using the same front fenders, doors, and rear fenders as the Camaro, the Firebird's styled split front grille, beaked hood, and GTO-slitted taillights gave it a distinctly Pontiac apperance. But the key differentiator was under the hood, where the Firebird offered a range of Pontiac engines.                                    The Ram Air engine included a hotter cam, stronger valve springs, and made use of the otherwise decrorative hood scoops. With no publicized power increase and a hefty $600 price tag, the Ram Air option was rarely ordered. All V8s came with a standard heavy-duty three speed manual transmission; a four speed manual and three speed automatic were optional. Performance axle ratios up to 4.33:1 were available as well as front disk brakes. Firebird prices were roughly $200 more than comparable Camaros and the Camaro outsold it two to one. But Pontiac's pony car had arrived.'",

The B.F. Goodrich Radial T/A was the first American-made tire that was DOT rated, and also had SCCA approval for track competition. In order to prove the new tire had what it took, B.F. Goodrich looked for a team and a series to run a street tire in professional competition. They found a perfect partner in Terry Godsall and Jerry Titus\u2019 T/G Racing. They had built a trio of Pontiac Firebirds for the 1970 season. At the end of the season papers were signed, and the Firebirds became Tire Birds. B.F. Goodrich took stock T/As and shaved off half the tread and had them put on the 3,200 lbs racecar. This Firebird eventually became the first production car to win a race using radial tires with a class win at Watkins Glen. At the 24 Hours of Daytona they moved up 14 places in the first 5 hours, but the 303 ci Pontiac V8 would let go early in the morning on Sunday, ending their race. They proved their point though, being the first street tire ever to run at Daytona.After Daytona the Firebird would become a Camaro. The team had already convinced the SCCA to allow this car to run with a Chevrolet engine instead of the problematic Pontiac engine based on the fact that Canadian Firebirds could be delivered with Chevrolet engines.",

They were the little Wisconsin car company that could, as long as it didn&#39;t involve speed, racing, performance, or impressing your friends at the local Psycho Taco.Factory body modification include the deletion of body side graphics and trim, custom Trans-Am homologated front cow-catcher and a Ronnie Kaplan designed rear adjustable &#39;air-foil&#39; style spoiler. Originally conceived in 1968 to showcase factory sponsored Ronnie Kaplan&#39;s SCCA Trans-Am racing team, the final cars came to market just in time to showcase the new AMC / Penske Javelin Racing Team.The first step after delivery of three Javelins was stiffening the unibody by welding all of the sheetmetal panels, as they came from the factory spot-welded. Stiffeners were added and the SCCA-approved rollcage that even tied into the top, as operating doors was a Trans-Am requirement. Stock suspensions were allowed only minimal changes, resulting in the &quot;dealer-installed&quot; Javelin Handling Package of heavier springs, a sway bar, a track bar, and heavy-duty shocks that were traded for Koni adjustable coilovers for racing.",

        "description": "The Boss 302 was Ford's best effort yet at SCCA racing. It had to be. While the Mustang was the original PonyCar, Ford received a challenger in the SCCA Trans-Am with the introduction of the Z28 Camaro. For 1970, Ford continued to up the ante with evolved aerodynamics and improved engine design. The factory BOSS 302 Trans-Am Mustangs started life as regular Mustang Sportsroofs, since the BOSS 302 Trans-Am development started many months before the street BOSS 302 Mustangs were into production. It was also cheaper for FORD to use fastbacks with just the basics, because the cars were stripped down and rebuilt anyway. So the race cars were not built up from production BOSSes for two reasons; time and money, critical to any racing program. In 1969, the basic construction of the Trans-Am cars was done by Kar Kraft in Dearborn, MI. FORD\u2019s high performance and racing division. Two teams raced the cars that year. The Shelby Racing Company and Bud Moore Engineering. The first two cars built by Kar Kraft were prototypes with one going to each team for development and testing. An additional car was also built and delivered to Smokey Yunick, but it never saw any action in the Trans-Am series. In all of the Trans-Am BOSSes, Kar Kraft installed roll cages and a heavy duty and highly modified suspension which included traction bars, extra heavy springs and sway bars, racing brakes and all the moving parts were attached with heim joints instead of rubber bushings. The cars also received fuel cells, full race BOSS 302 engines with 460 H.P., aluminum radiators and a lightweight and durable stainless steel exhaust system.",

Thanks to a 22 kg weight reduction, achieved by using lightweight aluminium, and combination with the Alfa TCT automatic transmission, this power unit allows the Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.6 seconds.A twin dry clutch automatic transmission, consisting of two gearboxes in parallel that allow the next gear to engage while the previous one is still engaged. The Alfa TCT offers continuous torque delivery without power loss during the shift, which becomes faster and more direct, translating into an even more intense driving sensation.",

Con una potenza di 350 CV, a 8.600 giri/minuto, e con un peso di soli 700 kg, che porta il rapporto peso/potenza al notevole (per quei tempi) valore di 2 kg/CV, l&#39;Alfa Romeo 158 non ha praticamente rivali, aggiudicandosi 6 dei 7 Gran Premi di questa prima stagione mondiale (si considerano 6 Gran Premi, perch&#233; alla 500 Miglia di Indianapolis, anche se introdotta nel circuito mondiale, non parteciparono n&#233; piloti n&#233; macchine europee). Il 7&#186; Gran Premio della stagione, il XXI Gran Premio d&#39;Italia, ultima prova del mondiale 1950, che si svolge il 3 settembre sul circuito di Monza, se lo aggiudica, al debutto, la Alfa Romeo 159, naturale evoluzione della 158, con, alla guida, Nino Farina, che si aggiudica anche il 1&#186; titolo di campione del mondo di Formula 1.I numeri di questa prima ed ultima avventura mondiale della Alfa Romeo 158, giunta alla sua tredicesima stagione, sono i seguenti: primi 3 posti nel Gran Premio di Gran Bretagna del 13 maggio 1950, con Nino Farina davanti a Luigi Fagioli, e, a seguire, Reg Parnell; 1&#186; posto nel Gran Premio di Monaco del 21 maggio 1950, con Juan Manuel Fangio; primi due posti nel Gran Premio di Svizzera, del 4 giugno 1950, con Nino Farina ancora davanti a Luigi Fagioli; primi due posti nel Gran Premio del Belgio del 18 giugno 1950, con Fangio davanti a Fagioli; primi due posti nel Gran Premio di Francia del 2 luglio 1950, con Fangio che precede, ancora una volta, Fagioli; 3&#186; posto con Fagioli, nell&#39;ultimo appuntamento mondiale del Gran Premio d&#39;Italia del 3 settembre. E poi, ancora, 5 giri veloci in 5 Gran Premi, e 5 pole position. Le doti principali di questa vettura, come riferirono tutti i grandi piloti che ebbero modo di condurla, furono potenza, velocit&#224;, affidabilit&#224;, estrema maneggevolezza.",

        "description": "This is the Ariel Atom Mugen. With a little help from Northamptonshire-based Mugen Euro (the European arm of Mugen, Honda\u2019s favoured tuning partner) ten of these &#163;50k Atoms are being built to celebrate the skeletal track car\u2019s tenth birthday.There\u2019s more power from the Mugen-tuned engine (a tweaked Type R engine in the Atom produces 245bhp; the Mugen Atom has 270bhp), adjustable suspension and an LCD dash from the Atom V8, plus unique wheels and paint. Our test car also sported the big wing and spoiler kit from the 500bhp V8 Atom. Read on for our first drive review of the new Ariel Atom Mugen.So what\u2019s the Ariel Atom Mugen like to drive?I last drove an Atom three years ago. In the wet. At Anglesey race circuit. And it was the screaming, shrieking and frankly terrifying supercharged 300. It\u2019s still the scariest car I\u2019ve ever driven.The Mugen, in comparison, is a doddle to drive. You need at least 6000rpm to really access the power, so below those revs everything is (a little) more relaxed. It\u2019ll still outpace anything this side of a supercar, but it won\u2019t scare you stupid like the torquey 300.The Mugen thrives on revs, it lives to be nailed to over 8000rpm. Shift up early and you\u2019ll drop below the VTEC zone and it grumble and sound unhappy just like an E46 M3 CSL does when it\u2019s not being nailed to the limit in each gear. Ignore the green and amber shift lights, wait for red LEDs to blink, then shift and you\u2019ll be in the power sweet spot. (Though perhaps the supercharged engine might suit the Atom better as it means you needn\u2019t nail it to the redline quite so much.)Just put an earplug in your left lug. There\u2019s a real pressure change around the air intake near 4500rpm, and it really does try and suck your eardrum out. The sensation might be exacerbated by my lanky height, but it\u2019s actually painful, and you will initially duck away from the air box over your left shoulder.Pedal positioning is spot on, the steering (though a lovely Alcantara wheel) is a feelsome delight, grip levels are high but the Atom can still be playful if you\u2019re brave, and (as with all Atoms) you still need to think a little bit more about the gearchange than you\u2019d like. You can\u2019t smash through the \u2018box like you would in a Caterham; instead a more delicate touch is needed, and when acceleration is so manic that\u2019s not the distraction that you need.Silly question, but how practical is the Mugen-spec Atom?Compared to a normal car? Not very. Compared to something similar like a Caterham? Well the Seven has a boot, and a roof, and doors, and can be had with a heater. The Atom? There\u2019s a little cubbyhole in the nose (barely big enough for the overnight cover). And nothing else.  In the past we\u2019ve tried Atoms with the optional windscreen, but you still need to wear a helmet as it only serves to funnel air into your eyes \u2013 and it ruins that glorious uninterrupted view out over the front wheels. Doors? Nope, just the chassis\u2019 scaffolding through which you can stick your arms, and through which water, dirt, wind and everything else can enter the cabin. Best to always wrap up warm.Inside it\u2019s remarkably spacious: unlike a Seven it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re driving in a straight jacket, and you don\u2019t need to open the door to apply some corrective lock. You need an Allen key to adjust the one-piece dual-bucket plastic seats, and they could offer a little more lower back support, but there\u2019s room to actually work at the wheel or stretch your legs.There\u2019s no leather or any other fabric to get wet, and you can happily stand on the plastics seats when climbing in (there\u2019s a hole through which stones and other debris can fall, rather than collecting in the buckets). And there\u2019s a certain simplistic joy to be had from parking up, leaving the Atom in gear (there\u2019s no handbrake) pulling the wheel off (it\u2019s your only real security measure), climbing out and walking away. No blipping a key fob or opening a door, just get out and simply leave it.",

The car was designed by American engineer Steve Nichols who previously had designed both of its turbocharged predecessors, the MP4/3, which was an all-new design for McLaren by Nichols, as well as its highly successful MP4/4 the following year/season.Over the course of two seasons, the MP4/5 took 16 wins, 27 pole positions and 263 points before it was replaced by the MP4/6 for 1991.",

        "description": "The Ferrari 643 was a Formula One car designed by Steve Nichols and Jean-Claude Migeot and was built by Scuderia Ferrari for use in the 1991 Formula One season. Built during May and introduced at the French Grand Prix, it initially looked to have potential to run at the front. Alain Prost qualified on the front row and took the lead, and although he was eventually passed by Nigel Mansell in his Renault powered Williams FW14, a second place in the car&#39;s first race looked promising. Aside from almost always being on the front part of the grid, it was not to be however.The chassis of the 643 was a total redesign over the 642 which suffered inconsistent handling issues, and was designed to allow for a more softer suspension travel, as per Prost&#39;s request. The car also featured Ferrari&#39;s first &#39;raised nose&#39; design which allowed better airflow underneath the car. The V12 engine was upgraded six major times during 1991, with the final evolution used from Portugal to the end of the season. The chassis itself had two revisions, the first after the French Grand Prix\u2014which saw a relocation of the exhaust exits from underneath the car, and Belgium which saw minor alterations to the body cover.Although arguably one of the prettier cars in the field, the car was not as competitive as the Williams and McLaren cars of 1991.A big problem with the car lay with a lack of correct data gathering due to the team&#39;s turbulent management structure at the time. The car&#39;s results (or lack thereof) was one of the main reasons for the falling out between Prost and Ferrari, with the Frenchman eventually saying that &#39;a truck would be easier to drive than this car&#39;. Following the Japanese Grand Prix, Prost was fired for the second time in his F1 career by a works team. The team replaced him in Australia with test driver Gianni Morbidelli.",

        "description": "The Footwork FA12 was a Formula One car designed and built by the Footwork Arrows team for the 1991 season. The number 9 car was driven by Michele Alboreto and the number 10 car was shared by Alex Caffi and Stefan Johansson. The team had no test driver.The FA12 was intended to start the season, but the new Porsche 3512 engine was so large and bulky that the car had to be re-designed to install it properly, so a 1990-based car called the FA11C was used for the first three race meetings.The FA12 finally debuted at the San Marino Grand Prix, where Caffi failed to qualify the new car (Alboreto still had an A11C). For the following Monaco Grand Prix both drivers had FA12s - Caffi once again failed to qualify and Alboreto retired from the race. Stefan Johansson replaced Caffi at the Canadian Grand Prix after Caffi sustained injuries in a road accident; this time both drivers qualified but both also retired from the race. The Mexican Grand Prix was the last appearance of the Porsche engine; Johansson failed to qualify and Alboreto again retired from the race.",

Leyton House Racing initially started the 1991 season with Maur&#237;cio Gugelmin and Ivan Capelli as their drivers, as they had in 1990, but Karl Wendlinger replaced Capelli for the final two races of the season. For 1992, when Leyton House renamed themselves as March F1, the CG911 was updated to the March CG911B specification, with Wendlinger, Jan Lammers, Paul Belmondo and Emanuele Naspetti all sharing driving duties. Although March initially intended to run the CG911C in 1993 with Lammers and Jean-Marc Gounon, the team folded and they did not compete that year.",

        "description": "The McLaren MP4/6 is a Formula One racecar that was designed by Neil Oatley for the 1991 F1 season. It was the first McLaren to be powered by a Honda V12 engine. The car was tested by Gerhard Berger in the off-season, but he was unimpressed with the new engine, feeling it was underpowered for what it was, especially compared to Honda&#39;s V10 engine in the previous year&#39;s car. When Ayrton Senna returned for pre-season testing, he knuckled down to try to solve the engine&#39;s problems. McLaren&#39;s domination in the early part of the year was mainly due to the lack of reliability of the Williams FW14.The MP4/6 raced throughout 1991 with a manual H pattern gearbox. A semi-automatic transmission was tested during the season, but was never regarded as good enough to be used in a race. Ferrari and Williams were the only teams using semi-automatic gearboxes during 1991. This makes the MP4/6 the last Formula One car to win a World Championship, either drivers or constructors, using a manual transmission or a V12 engine.Senna won the first four races of the season, in the United States, an emotional victory in Brazil, San Marino and Monaco before Williams and Nigel Mansell found their feet with their remarkable FW14 car, which dominated in the mid season. Consistent podium finishes throughout the year helped McLaren, but Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development programme and demanded further improvements to the car before it was too late. Honda responded with an updated version of the V12 engine, while Oatley redesigned various features of the car, especially the sidepods and wings. Failed electronics and a botched pitstop scuppered Williams&#39;s chances in Belgium and Portugal when in the lead allowing McLaren to take their fourth straight Constructors&#39; Championship and Senna his third and last Drivers&#39; Championship.The MP4/6 was considered by some to be the most competitive car in the field until Williams sorted the FW14, which was aerodynamically and technically more advanced.For the early races of 1992, McLaren used the MP4/6 (upgraded to MP4/6B spec) and Senna was able to take it to 3rd place in the South African Grand Prix before it was replaced by the MP4/7A for the Brazilian Grand Prix.The MP4/6 took 8 Grand Prix wins, 10 pole positions and scored 148 points in its career. The car brought a close to McLaren&#39;s domination of the sport, leaving the door open for Williams.",

Tyrrell scored 12 points to finish 6th in the Constructors&#39; Championship with half the points scored by Modena&#39;s 2nd in Canada.The car was powered by the 690 bhp (515 kW; 700 PS) Honda RA101-E V10 engine previously raced by McLaren in 1990.The car was updated for the 1992 season and was dubbed the 020B. For this season the Honda V10 was replaced with the 680 bhp (507 kW; 689 PS) Ilmor LH10 V10 engine and was driven by Olivier Grouillard and veteran Andrea de Cesaris. The team only scored 8 points for the season but again finished in 6th place.",

        "description": "The Williams FW14 is a Formula One car designed by Adrian Newey, used by the Williams team during the 1991 and 1992 Formula One seasons.The car was born out of necessity, as the 1989 and 1990 seasons had proven competitive for Williams, but they had underachieved in their own and Renault&#39;s eyes. Newey started work on the new car soon after joining the team from March in mid-1990. He had designed a series of aerodynamically efficient and very effective cars for March on a limited budget, so with Williams&#39;s greater resources and money he was able to fully develop his ideas. The design showed enough promise to tempt Nigel Mansell to shelve his plans to retire from the sport and rejoin Williams from Ferrari.Powered by a 3.5 litre V10 Renault engine, the car was the most technically sophisticated on the grid. By 1992 the FW14B featured semi-automatic transmission, active suspension, traction control and for a brief period anti-lock brakes. Add to that the superb aerodynamics by Newey that was far ahead of the McLaren MP4/7A, Ferrari F92A or Lotus 107, and it made for a potent mix, although at the beginning the unbelievers said the car was too technical for its own good. The FW14B was so successful that its successor (the FW15), which was already available mid-season in 1992, was never used.The FW14 made its debut at the 1991 United States Grand Prix. The car was clearly the most technically advanced on the grid, but teething troubles during the season stymied the team&#39;s early progress. Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese recorded 7 victories between them, but the Drivers&#39; Championship was wrapped up by Ayrton Senna in the McLaren MP4/6, who had better reliability.Williams had the faster car throughout the balance of the season and it provided a run of good form in the mid season for both Mansell and Patrese. Mansell in particular however had several retirements due to the then new-for-Williams semi-automatic transmission, with most of these retirements occurring while in a position to win races. Patrese was impressive on several occasions, and retired while leading twice. McLaren&#39;s superior reliability told in the Constructors&#39; Championship as well, as they narrowly took the title from Williams.",

        "description": "The Autozam AZ-1, known by the framecode PG6SA, is a mid-engined kei-class sports car, designed and manufactured by Mazda under its Autozam brand. Suzuki provided the engine as well as the inspiration for the design.Manufactured from October 1992 to October 1994, the AZ-1 was noted for its gullwing doors.[2] Power came from the same Suzuki-sourced 657 cc turbocharged engine used by the Suzuki Alto that produced 64 PS (47 kW) at 6,500 rpm and 85 N\u22c5m (63 lb\u22c5ft) at 4,000 rpm.Suzuki later produced its own badge engineered version named the Suzuki Cara (PG6SS).The proposal for the AZ-1 goes as far back as 1985 when Suzuki created the Suzuki RS/1 as a mid-engine sports car project for volume production.[1] Suzuki&#39;s design for the Tokyo Motor Show was a fully functional car with a front/rear weight distribution of 45:55,powered by a modified 1.3-liter G13B engine borrowed from the Cultus GTi.This was followed up by the Tatsumi Fukunaga-designed RS/3, unveiled for the 1987 Tokyo Motor Show. This version of the car retained many of its design features of the predecessor, but many of its design features were modified to meet Japanese safety regulations as well as for practicality. However, the project was abandoned in favor of the roadster project they had been working on, named later the Cappuccino.Mazda&#39;s design team, led by Toshihiko Hirai, who was also responsible for the MX-5, took over the design project, despite having a limited budget and capacity.The redesigned cars, constructed in tube frame with floors and bulkheads constructed from aluminium honeycomb, clad in three different body styles constructed in fiberglass. The cars were constructed around the Kei car regulations of the time (maximum length 126 inches (3,200 mm), maximum engine capacity 550 cc), until this was changed for the following March, hence its model name, AZ-550 Sports.[6]First introduced at the 1989 Tokyo Motor Show as the AZ-550 with three versions.The Type A was a red sports car with pop-up headlights, front air vent and gull-wing doors.The Type B, themed as &quot;High-tuned pure sports&quot;, was inspired by the trends in the tuning industry and in current concept car design, featuring greenhouse pyramid roof without a rearward sweep to the C-pillar. It had a racing car inspired interior, unlike Type A, it was aiming for the rough and spartan look and was the only model that a more conventional forward door hinging. It featured a pair of bulging headlamps and incorporated dual mufflers.The Type C, had a more distinctive body design as it was inspired by Mazda&#39;s Group C sports prototype racers, incorporating its signature colour scheme of blue on white and its number it bore at the 24 hours of Le Mans. Featuring a bigger air intake than the former two, venting to the forward-positioned radiator and exits it along the front rim of the cowl. There are many design cues typical to an endurance racer such as the wing mirror and BBS style brake-cooling wheel discs. Compared to the Type B, this version was far more spartan in comparison.Pre-productionAs the cars were well received by the visiting public and the motoring press, Mazda executives decided on production of the car. Although Type C was the better received of the three, Type A was given the green light by executives as they believed that it would be the one most commercially accepted by the buying public. The Type A would only receive a minor design alteration prior to production, as the pop-up headlights were dropped in favour of fixed units, purely for structural rigidity reasons. The front air vent was the other design alteration made to the car prior to production.Nonetheless, the car took three years to get into production as the engineering team changed the car&#39;s internal skeleton frame to steel to allow for further rigidity. The dashboard design was also changed, to a less futuristic but still sporting look.Much of the development work was carried out in the United Kingdom despite the fact that the car was never intended for sale outside Japan.ProductionRear viewThe car was made available to the buying public in January 1992, with two color options, Siberia Blue and Classic Red. Both colors came with Venetian Gray lower panels. Each car was sold through the Autozam dealer network in Japan.Unfortunately by the time car came into production, the recession in Japan had just come into force. Selling for 1,498 million &#165; (the equivalent of $12,400), it was slightly less than a Eunos Roadster, but marginally higher than its competitor, the Honda Beat selling at 1,388 million &#165;and the Suzuki Cappuccino at &#165;1,458 million,  the AZ-1 was considered to be both too expensive and too cramped for a kei car. The car failed to sell within its target of 800 per month, in the midst of an economic recession. Production of the car ended after the following year, but Mazda had plenty of stock to sell off.With a total production of 4,392 over a year, plus 531 Suzuki Cara, compared to 28,010 Cappuccinos[16] and 33,600 Beats (both with production reaching into the latter half of the 1990s).Alternative versionsIn a bid to shift unsold stock, Mazda made an effort to produce special versions. First to come was the Type L option, featuring an enhanced audio system including a sub-woofer in the boot. There were no exterior changes made to the car.",

        "description": "Mercedes-AMG GT Black SeriesThe GT Black Series is a high-performance variant of the Mercedes-AMG GT and was officially revealed on Mercedes-AMG&#39;s YouTube channel on 9 July 2020. The M178 engine in this variant is tuned to an output of 537 kW (730 PS; 720 hp) at 6,700-6,900 rpm and 800 N\u22c5m (590 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 2,000-6,000 rpm. Referred to as the M178 LS2, the engine has a slightly higher redline at 7,200 rpm compared to the GT R&#39;s 7,000 rpm, and uses a flat-plane crankshaft instead of a cross-plane crankshaft, turning out in different firing order. Additionally, the M178 LS2 uses a larger compressor wheel, resulting in an increase in boost from the GT R&#39;s 19.6 psi to 24.6 psi. The GT Black Series accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.2 seconds and has a claimed top speed of 325 km/h (202 mph).The suspension is unique, with a carbon-fibre anti-roll bar with two adjustment settings for the front axle, and an iron anti-roll bar with three adjustment settings for the rear axle. Like previous Black Series vehicles, the camber is manually adjustable for both the front and rear axles. Handling has been improved with carbon-fibre panels at the front and rear, as well as carbon-ceramic brake rotors and Black Series specific brake pads. The wing has an active aero flap, and contributes to a total maximum downforce of more than 400 kg (882 lb) at 249 km/h (155 mph). The Michelin Pilot Cup 2 R tires are specific to the car, and are available in M01A soft and M02 hard compounds.[30] Carbon-fibre is used extensively for most of the body, including the hood, roof, hatch and underbody. The exterior gains an enlarged grille, based on the Mercedes-AMG GT3, large air outlets on the hood, manually adjustable front splitter, and upgraded rear wing as part of a major aerodynamic kit. The interior features standard AMG performance bucket seats, and uses microfiber for the steering wheel, door and instrument panels.On 4th November 2020, The Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series recorded a lap time of 6:43.616 with driver Maro Engel behind the wheel at the N&#252;rburgring Nordschleife, making it the fastest lap time ever recorded for a road-legal production vehicle around the track at the time.",

        "description": "The Stage 3 tuned version of BMW 1M series has adjustable aftermarket dampers with coilover springs, camber plates to adjust for massive range of camber at the front, and rear toe links for equally big range of camber adjustment at the rear. The engine is tuned with a new ECU that raises the turbo boost at over 1bar with an overboost function of over 1.3 bar, adjustable from the cockpit. Beware though, the engine can't handle that kind of pressure for too much time.The letter M now comes to the segment of the BMW 1 Series to symbolise outstanding power delivery and the highly dynamic driving properties of a high-performance sports car. In the BMW 1 Series M Coupe, the technology of a high-performance car is combined with the agility and lightness of a compact model to create a whole new dimension of sports-style driving pleasure. With this 2-door model, BMW M GmbH is now realising for the first time in this vehicle class its concept of racing-oriented performance characteristics in a car developed for everyday use . This further extends the company's model range, paving the way for younger target groups to be able to access the hallmark driving experience offered by an M car.The BMW 1 Series M Coupe in-line 6-cylinder engine with M TwinPower Turbo and petrol direct injection develops a maximum output of 250 kW/340 bhp with an engine-speed-oriented characteristic curve typical of BMW M cars. With chassis technology derived directly from motor racing, a power-to-weight ratio reduced to 4.4 kilograms per bhp and precisely optimised aerodynamic components including innovative air curtains at the front end, supreme conversion of superior propulsion power into thrilling driving dynamics is guaranteed. The BMW 1 Series M Coupe accelerates in 4.9 seconds from zero to 100 km/h and reaches the 200 km/h mark after 17.3 seconds.",

And of course, everything has been tried and tested on the toughest proving ground in the world, the Nurburgring-Nordschleife. Underneath the distinctive powerdome: the V8 high-rev engine with up to 8.400 rpm which is transferred by the double-clutch transmission M DKG Drivelogic to the M differential lock and then to the rear wheels without the slightest disruption to tractive force.With a vehicle as powerful and dynamic as this, styling is never an aim in itself. Form will always be driven by functional considerations. The expressive front is designed to accommodate the V8 high-rev engine. The muscular rear allows for the wider track and four tailpipes. Even the shape of the exterior mirrors adds to the overall aerodynamics. Only the interplay of all these measures ensures the desired effect: sports car performance that is ideally suited to everyday driving.",

        "description": "The BMW M3 Race Version. Sportiness personified.In the course of developing the race version of the BMW M3, BMW engineers were faced with an ambitious task: to improve upon the sportiness of an already sporting car. A better base would, though, be difficult to find. In standard form the vehicle delivers powerful dynamics and sporting aesthetics.In order to enable the BMW M3 to make full use of this performance on the race circuit, the experts in Munich have not concentrated solely on the engine, but have race-tuned the chassis as well. The race version of the BMW M3 is wider and significantly lighter than its production equivalent, enabling it to perfectly transmit the power of its V8 to the track. Widespread use of carbon-reinforced plastic (CRP) provides proof of substantial weight reduction. As with the production version, the race car's roof is manufactured from this high-tech material.The race version of the BMW M3 is clearly aimed at the top echelon of motorsport. As such, it is no surprise to discover that in the course of its development, begun in mid-2007, numerous Formula One techniques were applied. These include computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel analyses, both of which have ensured the best possible aerodynamic package for the BMW M3.",

        "description": "The BMW Z4 GT3, which was officially launched and completed its first test drives at the start of March, is already enjoying great popularity among BMW Motorsport customers. The first cars have been delivered to private BMW teams, who will prepare them for use in various national and international championships.The largest difference between production and racing car can be found under the bonnet: while the production version of the BMW Z4 is driven by a six-cylinder engine, the GT3 car is powered by a 4.0-litre eight-cylinder engine similar to the unit used in the BMW M3 GT2. This powerful heart produces over 500 bhp. Its excellent performance characteristics and good torque curve make the base engine from the production version of the BMW M3 predestined for use in motorsport.The fitting of the V8 engine had a considerable influence on the development of the BMW Z4 GT3. Initially, design-space examinations were performed using CATIA V5 design software, in order to place the engine in the ideal position and meet racing specifications. The engineers then added all the other components.When it comes to electronics, the private teams can look forward to innovative BMW solutions, which have already been tried and tested on the BMW M3 GT2: the modern ECU408 takes over the engine management, while the Power400 electronic control unit is responsible for controlling all the actuators. The power is transmitted through a six-speed, sequential gearbox with &ldquo;Quick Shift&rdquo; function.The front axle of the BMW Z4 GT3 is a completely new design, based on a series concept. It is equipped with a tubular stabiliser bar with adjustable blades. The rear axle is designed as a longitudinal link axle, as with the series version of the BMW Z4. During the development, BMW Motorsport engineers worked hand in hand in other areas with their colleagues from series production. This allowed them to access calculations from the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) when designing the car's aerodynamics. Furthermore, tests were also carried out in the wind tunnel and on the BMW Group's test benches.Front and rear wings, bonnet, roof, fender and many other components are made of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). Using this lightweight, torsion-resistant material contributed significantly to reducing the weight of the BMW Z4 GT3 to 1,200 kilograms.As with all cars in the BMW customer racing range, the emphasis was also put on cost-efficiency when developing the BMW Z4 GT3. As a result, the car offers a very good cost/performance ratio and gives private teams the opportunity to participate in affordable motorsport at the highest level.",

        "description": "Challenging yourself means being able to reach everything, but never the zenith. The 2015 introduced Mercedes-AMG GT3 immediately set new benchmarks. Its successor, unveiled in 2019, defines a new level of user-friendliness and economic efficiency.PERFORMANCEWith its innovative motorsport technologies, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 is combining performance and reliability at a high level. The intuitive and effective race-track set-up unleashes considerable performance reserves, guaranteeing an amazing competitiveness from the very first lap onwards. At the same time, the everyday working conditions for drivers, mechanics and engineers are made easier as a result.Engine and electronics.The GT3\u2019s AMG 6.3 litre V8 engine convinces with performance and reliability. Thanks to its dry-sump lubrication, it has been placed particularly low, contributing to a precise handling. The electronic driving dynamics control systems, from traction control to ABS, have been specifically developed for racing purposes. A drop-start function that automatically starts the engine once the car is being lowered from its air jacks is available as an option.AMG 6-speed racing gearbox.For extremely quick gearshift, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 comes with a sequential six-speed racing gearbox. Its differential is adjustable from the outside and it has been mounted on the rear axle in transaxle configuration. A carbon torque tube is the connection to the engine, torsion and torque rigid.Racing suspension.Precise handling, exact feedback, perfect deceleration: all these qualities enable drivers to quickly build confidence in the Mercedes-AMG GT3. Chassis and braking system provide top-notch racing technology, from the adjustable anti-roll bars and dampers to the ABS, adjustable by the driver in the cockpit in multiple ways.EXTERIEURThe Mercedes-AMG GT3\u2019s design reflects pure performance potential. The wide body, the large air intakes, the mighty rear wing: every aspect of this performance sports car is impressive. In the process, every detail serves a functional purpose and contributes to the overall performance.The appearance of a champion.Next to the Mercedes-AMG GT3\u2019s characteristic grille, the adjustable carbon front splitter immediately catches attention. It enhances the downforce on the front axle, just like the flics mounted on the sides. Air intake openings in the front apron contribute, among others, to an effective cooling of the front braking system.A dominant wing.The multi-adjustable rear wing and the striking diffuser ensure maximum downforce on the rear axle and a high aerodynamic performance. Large openings in the Mercedes-AMG GT3\u2019s rear apron lead the hot air away from the rear wheels.LED light package.A new, optimised light package adds to the Mercedes-AMG GT3\u2019s characteristic looks. Next to the powerful LED main headlights that ensure a brilliant illumination of the track, high-performance additional lights are optionally available for endurance races.INTERIEURThe Mercedes-AMG GT3\u2019s cockpit convinces with perfect ergonomics and a functional race car atmosphere: every detail has been well thought-out and optimised for its purpose, everything is aimed at maximum user-friendliness. The central element in the interior is a carbon safety cell, another benchmark-setting feature in the GT3.A safe working place.The carbon seat box is part of the safety concept. It has been bolted to the steel roll cage and the aluminium space frame and, together with the integrated headrest and a six-point safety belt with reinforced connections, it provides protection that has been adapted for the race track.Ergonomic interior.In the Mercedes-AMG GT3, all the controls have been arranged intuitively and are within easy reach. Fluorescent signs also ensure good visibility at night. The central console is tilted towards the driver for an easier and quick access to the switches located there.Total control.The racing steering wheel with shift paddles for the gear change allows for perfect car control. With buttons on the steering wheel, the driver can activate additional functions like the pit radio, flasher or the drinking system. Rubberised contact surfaces ensure optimum grip and damping during race use.Adjustable racing pedals.As a result of the fixed seat, adaptation to drivers of different sizes is exclusively achieved by adjusting the steering wheel and the pedals in the Mercedes-AMG GT3, not by moving the seat. The latter remains in its position, so that the car\u2019s centre of gravity and the weight distribution across the wheels remain unchanged at all times.Information centre DDU.The central display has been positioned exactly within the driver\u2019s field of view. The so-called DDU (Digital Display Unit) shows relevant information like speed, engine speed, working temperatures, lap times, selected gear and upshift advice. The driver can access additional information by means of a switch on the steering wheel.Always keep cool.During a race, the heat is not just limited to the on-track action, it can get pretty hot in the cockpit, too. Therefore, the Mercedes-AMG GT3 can be fitted with air conditioning and adjustable seat and helmet ventilation if required. Together with the effective interior ventilation, these systems significantly add to relieving the driver.",

        "description": "Since the 2014 season onwards all cars are built to the same NGTC regulations. First introduced in 2011 for an initial 5 year period, these technical regulations are designed to dramatically reduce the design, build and running costs of the cars and engines. Only NGTC cars are now eligible to compete in the BTCC. TOCA extended these regulation for a further 6 years from 2016.NGTC allows independent teams to compete on a level playing field against manufacturer-backed efforts by keeping costs down whilst at the same time rewarding precise engineering and all-important split-second strategy.The foundation for NGTC is an emphasis on some common components, so turbo, wastegate, intercoolers, ECU, instrumentation and dash, power management system, six-speed sequential gearbox, fuel tanks, differential, subframe, steering, brakes, clutch, wheels, dampers and suspension, which dramatically drives down costs for teams looking to compete in one of the world&#39;s most attractive motor sport arenas.2016 sees the introduction of a new Technical Partner for the common subframes, suspension and new hydraulic power steering whilst all other Technical Partners were keen to continue their association with the BTCC.Teams have the option of running either TOCA&#39;s unbranded NGTC-spec engine or, whether privateer or full manufacturer-backed entries, developing their own powerplant to the regulations, as long as it is from the same &#39;family&#39; as their chosen model of car.

Now, from the off, there\u2019s impossible not to spot the exposed, jet-black carbon fiber that runs throughout the car\u2019s whole body. Bugatti says that\u2019s exactly what the Super Sport\u2019s customers will get, which is extremely cool. Moreover, the carmaker designed the Chiron Super Sport as a complementary piece next to your Veyron Super Sport, hence the decision to keep the exposed carbon fiber as well as the Jet Orange stripes. It\u2019s certainly nice to be filthy rich and a gearhead, matching super-expensive cars like they\u2019re pairs of socks, we\u2019ll tell you that much.version 1.0",

The pedigree is world class, with the previous Continental GT3 being a proven championship-winning endurance racer, scoring over 126 podiums and 50 wins around the world to date.W.O. Bentley promised always to build a \u201cgood car, fast car, best in its class\u201d and this is no different with the race car. Development of the new Continental GT3 has been led with passion and innovation by the engineers of Bentley Motorsport\u2019s in-house team based in Crewe, and supported across the car by designers and technicians at Bentley\u2019s technical partner, M-Sport.The new GT3 race car was developed in tandem with the recently launched Continental GT road car, and the performance learnings are many. It utilises a mostly aluminium structure to deliver a much lighter, race-ready weight of significantly less than 1300 kg together with more even weight distribution \u2013 ideal for racing. The engine is a new development of the race-proven 4.0-litre Bentley twin-turbo V8, with a redesigned dry sump system and all-new intake and exhaust systems. Unrestricted power is in excess of 550 bhp, fuel consumption is improved and despite reduced exhaust noise the sound is still unmistakably Bentley.",

        "description": "The BMW Z4 GT3, which was officially launched and completed its first test drives at the start of March, is already enjoying great popularity among BMW Motorsport customers. The first cars have been delivered to private BMW teams, who will prepare them for use in various national and international championships.The largest difference between production and racing car can be found under the bonnet: while the production version of the BMW Z4 is driven by a six-cylinder engine, the GT3 car is powered by a 4.0-litre eight-cylinder engine similar to the unit used in the BMW M3 GT2. This powerful heart produces over 500 bhp. Its excellent performance characteristics and good torque curve make the base engine from the production version of the BMW M3 predestined for use in motorsport.The fitting of the V8 engine had a considerable influence on the development of the BMW Z4 GT3. Initially, design-space examinations were performed using CATIA V5 design software, in order to place the engine in the ideal position and meet racing specifications. The engineers then added all the other components.When it comes to electronics, the private teams can look forward to innovative BMW solutions, which have already been tried and tested on the BMW M3 GT2: the modern ECU408 takes over the engine management, while the Power400 electronic control unit is responsible for controlling all the actuators. The power is transmitted through a six-speed, sequential gearbox with \u201cQuick Shift\u201d function.The front axle of the BMW Z4 GT3 is a completely new design, based on a series concept. It is equipped with a tubular stabiliser bar with adjustable blades. The rear axle is designed as a longitudinal link axle, as with the series version of the BMW Z4. During the development, BMW Motorsport engineers worked hand in hand in other areas with their colleagues from series production. This allowed them to access calculations from the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) when designing the car&#39;s aerodynamics. Furthermore, tests were also carried out in the wind tunnel and on the BMW Group&#39;s test benches.Front and rear wings, bonnet, roof, fender and many other components are made of carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP). Using this lightweight, torsion-resistant material contributed significantly to reducing the weight of the BMW Z4 GT3 to 1,200 kilograms.As with all cars in the BMW customer racing range, the emphasis was also put on cost-efficiency when developing the BMW Z4 GT3. As a result, the car offers a very good cost/performance ratio and gives private teams the opportunity to participate in affordable motorsport at the highest level.",

        "description": "Read the Readme of the car!!!BOP (URD M4, my other Cars): 70% Restriktor, 15kg BallastHans Reiter, Reiter Engineering founder and director, got the idea to convert a Chevrolet Camaro into a GT car during a stay in the USA in 2010. The unique design and the status of a \u201cmen\u2019s car\u201d were the determining factors for developing it into a GT racing car.The FIA had approved the start for the homologation in October 2010. A team of 12 experts implemented the specifications and requirements within a short period of time, leading to the first test drives in 2011. Experienced pilots like Peter Kox (NLD) and Charlie Geipel (DEU) have been responsible for testing the Camaro thoroughly.The development took 12 months in total and Reiter Engineering in Germany did all the development work at the highest level. SARENI United was founded for this project. In the future it will manage all matters regarding the Camaro GT racing car as an independent company.The heart of the Camaro with a 7.9 litre cubic capacity, with more than 650 HP and the enormous torque of more than 800 Nm, is designed and manufactured by KATECH, a very successful engine manufacturer with headquarters in Clinton, MI. KATECH received the following specifications: close-to-production, low cost, service performance of 10,000 km and maximum power.The light gear box (37 kg) which is able to convert the high torque is produced by Holinger from Germany. Holinger is a very experienced and reliable partner.Security was a main concern for the Camaro GT. In addition to the mandatory roll cage it provides a newly designed fuelling system which was developed by Krontec and will raise the bar with regard to security. Krontec will launch this system in 2012. There is also a big crush zone in the front and the rear of the car, conditioned by the outside dimensions.A maximum of 20 units will be manufactured every year.",

The body and dashboard were CAD-designed by Paul Deutschman, Callaway\u2019s designer of over 30 years, of Montreal, Canada. Design details were finalized via international telephone. At the end of 2014, the vehicle design was established and, in the spring of 2015, vehicle construction was started in Leingarten.After Callaway Competition provided data, customers and suppliers milled forms for the body parts. The carbon parts from these forms were chiefly manufactured in Leingarten, with some produced by friendly firms.The only stock components retained from the Corvette C7 are the chassis, which is reinforced with the roll cage, the lower control arms, the upper half of the rear bumper, and the tail lights. The engine was carried over from its predecessor with minor changes. All other parts were newly developed and manufactured, with the major part of the technical components from aluminum and carbon fiber hand-built in Leingarten.The front spoiler, diffuser and rear wing aerodynamic parts were of aerodynamic core (Paul Schreiber and Alex Koppe) are developed and implemented in CAD. The shape and the profile of the rear wing corresponds to all the latest developments and offers a high level of innovation.Business owners, Giovanni Ciccone and Ernst W&#246;hr, put a great deal of sweat and blood and all their experience of the last ten years in the construction of the Corvette C7 GT3-R.",

        "description": "The Dodge Viper evolved into its 3rd generation model at the 2012 New York Motor Show. With the appearance of this iconic American sports car, the development of a GTS-R competition model was also announced, and it became clear that the Viper would return once again to the Le Mans 24 hour race and American Le Mans series after a 10-year hiatus. And the Viper GT3-R is a GT3 machine created for private teams, based on the GTS-R works machine.In the development of this machine, SRT (the high-performance car development division of Dodge) and Riley Technologies (a major race constructor of the U.S.) worked together to instil the car with their know-how for victory.The traditional long nosed, short deck body has improved aerodynamics with a flat bottom and the addition of a wing. Weight has also been reduced to 1,295 kg (2855 lbs). The 8.4 litre V10 with a dry sump is powered up to 670 BHP (507kW) unrestricted, and this power is transferred with an X-Trac 6-speed sequential transmission. It is also equipped with 6 piston front/4 piston rear brake callipers with large diameter discs for stopping power.The Viper GT3-R was priced at $459,000, with orders received from the latter half of 2013. Its level of performance is already proven in various GT Car races in the US and other parts of the world.",

        "description": "For use in the Super GT (formerly the JGTC), the NSX has been highly modified (as allowed by series technical regulations) with chassis development done by Dome, engine development by Mugen, for Honda.Externally, the NSX &#39;s shape has developed race by race, season to season to the demands of increasing aerodynamic downforce within the regulations. The most notable change is the position of the V6 engine, which is mounted longitudinally instead of transversely as per the road car. Similar to the setup used in modern Lamborghinis, the gearbox is located in the center tunnel under the cockpit and is connected to the rear differential by a driveshaft. Engines can either be turbocharged or naturally aspirated, depending on the class and on the rules.Prior to rule changes beginning in the 2003 season, the Super GT/GT500 NSX was powered by a specially modified version of the C32B V6 engine. Using a stroker crankshaft from Toda Racing, the naturally aspirated engine displaced 3.5-litres and produced nearly 500 hp (373 kW; 507 PS). Beginning in 2003, Honda substituted a highly modified C30A engine, augmented by a turbocharger, which also produces up to 500 bhp.The NSX continued to be used as the works Honda car in the GT500 class, even though it is no longer in production, until it was replaced in 2010 with the HSV-010. New 2014 regulations however will render the HSV-010 obsolete; Honda&#39;s 2014-spec GT500 car is to be based on the 2015 NSX, followed with a Group GT3 version from 2017 onwards. Cars were entered by Raybrig and ARTA in the 2005 Super GT season, Castrol Mugen Motorsports in 2000, Loctite in 2001 and Epson in the 2007 Super GT season.",

        "description": "Since first appearing in 1995, Toyota has raced the JZA80 Supra as a GT500 race car in the JGTC series. Beginning with a four-cylinder 2.1-liter turbocharged 4T-GTE mounted onto a stock bodyshell with wide arch body kit and spoiler.Over the years, as demands for expensive GT1 race specials became common, the JGTC regulation drifted away from FIA rules, as a result, the Supra has progressively underwent numerous changes over the years, most noticeable, the numerous body changes and by the late 1990s, the Supra used a developed version of the 3SG, which was developed from the IMSA engine and similar to the 3SGTE engine found in the Toyota Corolla WRC car. By the early 2000s, for the benefit of torque, the Supra moved on to 3UZ-FE V8 engine.Altogether, the Supra has taken the title four times in 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2005. Despite being out of production since 2002, factory teams continued to use JZA80 Supras with continued successes. The car&#39;s swansong competitive year was in 2006, when it was used by Toyota Team Tsuchiya and Toyota Team SARD, since then, the Supra has since being replaced by the Lexus SC.",

        "description": "The Xanavi Nismo Z was dominant in the 2005 Super GT Series mainly because of Nissan&#39;s mighty 3.0-liter twin-turbo V6.For the 2006 season, this power plant became even more potent thanks to a revised bore, stroke and compression ratio that boosted power output and improved fuel economy. But what caught the eye of most observers was the car&#39;s new exterior appearance, which was radically altered to improve aerodynamic efficiency. Nissan modified the front and rear fenders of the Fairlady Z for increased downforce at high speed, while the rear fenders were defined by a complex presentation of air outlets and fins, looking somewhat like Europe&#39;s DTM (German Touring Car Championship) race cars. The result was a more ground-hugging machine whose aerodynamic efficiency was improved by nearly four percent. This meant that the revived Z was capable of higher cornering speed; however, the extra power uncovered weaknesses in the Z&#39;s overall structure. The chassis wasn&#39;t rigid enough to handle the increased loads. To compensate for this, the rear subframe and the front end - including the roll cage - were reinforced.Unfortunately, the team couldn&#39;t defend its 2005 championship, finishing 6th in driver points in 2006.NOTE: Engine Sound is Placeholder",

Often called &quot;an umbrella on wheels&quot;, the fixed-profile convertible bodywork featured a full-width, canvas, roll-back sunroof, which accommodated oversized loads and until 1955 reached almost to the car&#39;s rear bumper.Manufactured in France between 1948 and 1989 (and in Portugal from 1989 to 1990), over 3.8 million 2CVs were produced, along with over 1.2 million small 2CV-based delivery vans known as Fourgonnettes. Citro&#235;n ultimately offered several mechanically identical variants including the Ami (over 1.8 million); the Dyane (over 1.4 million); the Acadiane (over 250,000); and the Mehari (over 140,000). In total, Citro&#235;n manufactured almost 9 million 2CVs and variants.A 1953 technical review in Autocar described &quot;the extraordinary ingenuity of this design, which is undoubtedly the most original since the Model T Ford&quot;. In 2011, The Globe and Mail called it a &quot;car like no other&quot;. The motoring writer L. J. K. Setright described the 2CV as &quot;the most intelligent application of minimalism ever to succeed as a car&quot;,[page needed] and a car of &quot;remorseless rationality&quot;.",

When Planchon&#39;s foresight was shown to be correct Delage sacked him and replaced him with assistant Albert Lory, who oversaw the engine&#39;s further development into a powerful and successful Grand Prix winner. The fact that Delage and Planchon were cousins may have made for some frosty family gatherings in later years.Driven by Rene Thomas - veteran racer, 1914 Indianapolis 500 winner, pilot (and in 1910 participant in the world&#39;s first mid-air collision) - the Delage led at the race start but was quickly overtaken by a FIAT, retiring in fifth place. For the moment it was another of the Tours Grand Prix&#39;s also-rans that also showed the first signs of future success and technological development in Grand Prix racing.",

        "description": "Like a true racecar, the Formula Skip Barber 2000 is based around a steel space frame chassis much like that of the old Formula Ford racecar, a proven cost effective rigid body that has been lapping track around the world since before most of us were born. Despite the Mazda logos on the winged Reynard designed fiberglass body work and side pods, the engines are carried over from the school`s involvement with Chrysler, so the Formula Skip Barber 2000 is powered by a 2.0 Liter 16 valve four banger that has been modified to withstand the constant full throttle abuse of the track.",

It was DaimlerChrysler Performance Vehicle Operation, now Street and Racing Technology or SRT, which developed the group&#39;s most powerful cars.The new Viper SRT-10 was born which was deeply revised both in the aesthetic profile, with a new and more angular body, and in the engine. The engine is an 8.3-liter 90 &#176; angle V10 with multipoint direct electronic injection that delivers over 500 HP (372 kW) at 5600 rpm, the same as the Dodge Ram SRT10. Thanks to an impressive 712 N m of maximum torque at 4250 rpm the car sprints from 0-100 km / h in 3.9 s (even if the real time is higher due to the absence of traction control) and reaches a top speed of about 315 km / h.Mixed fuel consumption is always very high, i.e. 3.5 km / l. The gearbox is manual with six gears as for all the Vipers produced, used as an alternative to the faster sequential with paddle on the steering wheel, and mounted on almost all Dodge vehicles of the time. It is fitted with front P275 / 35ZR18 and rear P345 / 30ZR19 tires. Like the previous Viper, it has no electronic driving aids.At first only one version, the roadster (convertible), was made available. The coupe version was presented as a 2006 model year at the 2005 Detroit Auto Show.",

        "description": "In the 1960s, Brabham was the world&#39;s largest manufacturer of open-wheel racing cars for sale to customer teams; by 1970 it had built more than 500 cars. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three. Brabham cars also competed in the Indianapolis 500 and in Formula 5000 racing. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced such innovations as in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and hydropneumatic suspension. Its unique Gordon Murray designed &quot;fan car&quot; won its only race before being withdrawn.The team won two more Formula One Drivers&#39; Championships in the 1980s with Brazilian Nelson Piquet. He won his first championship in 1981 in the Ground effects BT49-Ford, and became the first to win a Drivers&#39; Championship with a turbocharged car, in 1983. In 1983 the Brabham BT52, driven by Piquet and Italian Riccardo Patrese, was powered by the BMW M12 straight-4 engine, and powered Brabham to four of the team&#39;s 35 Grand Prix victories.British businessman Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.",

The team debuted in 1973 with a customer Shadow DN1 car, and began racing as a constructor with its own chassis in 1975. The team had limited success in three seasons of racing, but everything was cut short by the death of Hill, Tony Brise and some of the team&#39;s top personnel in the crash of a light aircraft in the autumn before the 1976 season. The team was sponsored by Imperial Tobacco&#39;s Embassy cigarette brand and ran under various names during its time.",

        "description": "The Lotus 72 was a Formula One car designed by Colin Chapman and Maurice Philippe of Lotus for the 1970 Formula One season.This was yet another innovative design by Chapman featuring inboard brakes, side mounted radiators in sidepods, as opposed to the nose mounted radiators which had been commonplace since the 1950s and an overhead air intake. The overall shape of the car was innovative too, resembling a wedge on wheels which was inspired by the earlier Lotus 56 gas turbine car, and the layout taken from the Lotus 63 four wheel drive project testbed. The shape made for better air penetration and higher speeds. In a back-to-back test with the Lotus 49, the 72 was 12 mph faster with the same Cosworth engine.Chapman&#39;s efforts produced one of the most remarkable and successful designs in F1 history. Taking the stressed engine layout technique from the Lotus 49 and adding advanced aerodynamics produced a car that was years ahead of its rivals. To begin with however, problems with the handling of the car had to be overcome, due to a lack of &#39;feel&#39; caused by the anti-dive suspension geometry - which was designed to prevent the nose of the car dipping significantly under braking - and the anti-squat set-up at the rear, which was supposed to stop the car &#39;squatting down&#39; under acceleration. Once the suspension was modified, there were no further problems. The car caused a sensation amongst the media and fans, with many people clamouring to see the remarkable car in action.",

        "description": "For the mid-1970s, F1 stipulated that the maximum width of the front wing was 1.5 m. Considering the needed room for the driver&#39;s feet, the steering mechanism, suspension and the normal front tyre size, this meant the front tyres projected above and out to the sides of the wing. P34&#39;s basic concept was to use a tyre that would be small enough to fit entirely behind the wing. This would have two effects; one would be to lower overall drag and thus improve speed on straights and the other was to clean up overall aerodynamics so the rear wing would receive cleaner airflow.However, given the space limitations such a tyre would have to be quite small, eventually settling on a 10 inches (250 mm) diameter. This had too small a contact patch to offer reasonable cornering performance, which led to the use of four wheels instead of two. Adding more wheels also had the advantage of offering more total brake area. The downside was increased complexity of the steering system and a physically larger suspension system. The steering complexity was solved by connecting only the front pair of wheels to the steering wheel and connecting the rear set to the front with a bell crank. Initially considered to be a problem area, Joel Rosinsky later declared that &quot;The steering is so gentle and absolutely free of reaction that you might have thought it was power-assisted!&quot;The new design was unveiled at the Heathrow Hotel in late September 1975. The car was initially kept under a tarpaulin with hoops over the wheels that make it look conventional, leading to astonishment when the tarp was pulled off. Some in the audience were convinced the design was a publicity stunt. The car first took to the track at Silverstone on 8 October 1975, and after more tests, Tyrrell decided to build two more examples with a slightly longer wheelbase to race in the 1976 season.",

        "description": "The 36th edition of the Bologna Motor Show provides the venue for the unveiling of an evolution of the extreme, non-homologated sports berlinetta, the 599XX. Ferrari has introduced a package of performance-enhancing technical features available to clients participating in the track-based research and development programme for the 2012-2013 seasons.Already the fruit of the very finest Ferrari road car and Formula 1-derived technology, the 599XX now features improved chassis dynamics thanks to an active aerodynamic package integrated with the vehicles' electronic control systems, and the adoption of new Pirelli tyres. The car is also more powerful than before (750 CV) and weighs 35 kg less.The key to the aero package is the active rear wing design which represents a new aerodynamic concept called 'opening gap'. The wing features two flaps, with profiles similar to those used in Formula 1, which rotate electronically to adjust the downforce between the front and rear axles in function of vehicle speed and the manoeuvre being effected. The result of this concept is better performance in cornering.The 599XX active rear wing is actuated automatically according to specific parameters which are integrated with the car's other control functions (ESP, ABS, SCM and F1-Trac). As a result of this integration, all the electronic controls have been suitably recalibrated. The 'opening gap' system logic is based on the following parameters:- steering wheel angle- longitudinal acceleration- lateral acceleration- vehicle speedThe new aerodynamics package for the 599XX also includes a modified front splitter and a new rear diffuser featuring a larger surface area and redesigned fences and foot-plates. Total downforce at 200 km/h is boosted to 330 kg when the flaps are open and 440 kg in the closed configuration.",

        "description": "The F40 was built to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary. A very fast berlinetta designed by Pininfarina, it was built mainly from composites. Its sophisticated high-performance, turbo-charged running gear combined with a first class chassis gave it the kind of great dynamic prowess that was close to that of a racing car. It was greeted with great enthusiasm by enthusiasts and the number of examples eventually built exceeded the company's wildest dreams.The bodies were mounted on a 2450mm wheelbase chassis, as on the GTO, but both front and rear track were increased, as was the overall length mainly due to the longer more aerodynamic nose. The chassis had factory reference numbers F 120 AB, all were numbered in the continuous chassis number road car sequence, which commenced from chassis number 75000. The construction followed the Ferrari principle of a tubular steel chassis frame, now with a progressively deformable front section to meet increasing legislation worldwide. The overall premise was similar to that of the GTO, however there were additional stiffening braces, and the composite elements were bonded to the chassis frame with a special adhesive to provide even greater strength. The F40 was the first series production car to use mainly composite materials for its body panels, which totalled only eleven pieces, due to the large single unit front and rear sections. Whereas the GTO chassis had a bolted rear section to simplify engine removal, this element was unnecessary on the F40 due to the fully removable rear body section, which provided good access to all the mechanical components. Large cross drilled ventilated disc brakes with twin hydraulic circuits, without servo assistance. Independent suspension via tubular steel wishbones, coil springs, and hydraulic shock absorbers was provided, together with front and rear anti roll bars. The mid mounted engine was a 90 degree V8 unit fitted longitudinally as in the GTO.

        "description": "The Stage 3 version of the Ferrari F40, comes with the factory option of modified turbos and boost, to raise the already impressive factory power to an outrageous value of over 600bhp. The car also comes equipped with heavy duty track oriented suspension and slick tyres, making this version just a step lower than the all mighty LM racing version. Incredibly, even though the original car has more than enough power, this engine modification is found on quite a big number of the F40's in the market.The F40 was built to celebrate Ferrari's 40th anniversary. A very fast berlinetta designed by Pininfarina, it was built mainly from composites. Its sophisticated high-performance, turbo-charged running gear combined with a first class chassis gave it the kind of great dynamic prowess that was close to that of a racing car. It was greeted with great enthusiasm by enthusiasts and the number of examples eventually built exceeded the company's wildest dreams.The bodies were mounted on a 2450mm wheelbase chassis, as on the GTO, but both front and rear track were increased, as was the overall length mainly due to the longer more aerodynamic nose. The chassis had factory reference numbers F 120 AB, all were numbered in the continuous chassis number road car sequence, which commenced from chassis number 75000. The construction followed the Ferrari principle of a tubular steel chassis frame, now with a progressively deformable front section to meet increasing legislation worldwide. The overall premise was similar to that of the GTO, however there were additional stiffening braces, and the composite elements were bonded to the chassis frame with a special adhesive to provide even greater strength. The F40 was the first series production car to use mainly composite materials for its body panels, which totalled only eleven pieces, due to the large single unit front and rear sections. Whereas the GTO chassis had a bolted rear section to simplify engine removal, this element was unnecessary on the F40 due to the fully removable rear body section, which provided good access to all the mechanical components. Large cross drilled ventilated disc brakes with twin hydraulic circuits, without servo assistance. Independent suspension via tubular steel wishbones, coil springs, and hydraulic shock absorbers was provided, together with front and rear anti roll bars. The mid mounted engine was a 90 degree V8 unit fitted longitudinally as in the GTO. However the development work on the Evoluzione models in the interim saw a small increase in capacity, a slightly higher compression ratio of 7.7:1, a rise in boost pressure, and numerous other changes that resulted in a significant increase in power output and also improved torque. The total cubic capacity was 2936cc.

The engineers' aim was to deliver the highest degree of aerodynamic efficiency ever achieved with any road car, with a coefficient of nearly 3, thanks to technical solutions honed with CFD analysis and fine-tuned in the F1 Wind Tunnel.Thanks to myriad innovations across the board in its design and construction, the LaFerrari delivers absolutely exceptional performance, establishing itself as Ferrari's fastest-ever road car. The LaFerrari slashes more than 5 seconds off the Enzo's lap record at the Fiorano circuit.",

        "description": "The 911 GT1 was developed for works and customer appearances in GT races during the mid-1990s, making its racing debut in 1996. The GT1 was the first ever 911 to have a water-cooled mid-mounted engine, which as well as balanced axle load distribution also offered aerodynamic benefits. Behind a Joest Team TWR Porsche WSC 95, the new GT race car immediately achieved a double victory in the GT1 category at Le Mans in 1996, along with second and third place in the overall ranking. In 1997, both 911 GT1s dropped out of Le Mans due to technical problems encountered just before the end of the race. A year later, a revised version of the 911 GT1 competed at Le Mans, which was the first time Porsche entered a sports car with a carbon fibre chassis. Thanks to its CFK monocoque, reworked front axle suspension and battery and generator weight savings, the 911 GT1 98 weighed around 50 kilograms less than its predecessor. The engine output was increased by a further 50 hp, thanks to its modified engine management system. Another new feature was the three-disc racing clutch made of carbon fibre. As a fitting tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Porsche sports car brand, the 911 GT1 recorded a double victory for the Zuffenhausen-based manufacturer at the 24h of Le Mans in 1998.updated by GTSupdated ro real specs and lap time1.1 27.12.2022more real. reworked physics1.2 (05.2023)frond splitter/wings adjustment fix, small aero fix, fuel consumption fix1.21 (06.2023) aero fix, important1.3 (10.2023)rear diffuser downforce fix1.4 (12.2023) fixed tyre speed sensitivity",

        "description": "Among the modifications were an extension of the front and rear bodywork, including a larger splitter attached to the front of the car. The bodywork was also modified to allow it to be removed more quickly for easier repair. The car&#39;s normally stock gearbox was modified to include a lighter magnesium housing and more robust mechanicals. These modifications allowed for the weight of the GTR to be lowered by 38 kg.Although equipped with a restricted engine that produced less power than the road car, slower on an entire lap than the 1997 long-tail version due to the significantly lower downforce (the 1997 model relied on high-speed cornering much like prototypes of the 2000s), the F1 GTR of 1996 was the fastest variant in terms of straight line speed. The car hit 330 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans in 1996, which is 13 km/h faster than the 1997 long-tail F1 GTR and even 6 km/h faster than the 1996 Porsche GT1.updated by GTS for private use onlyupdated ro real specs and lap time1.1 27.12.2022more real. reworked physics1.2 (05.2023)frond splitter/wings adjustment fix, visual ground clearance, fuel consumption fix1.3 (10.2023)rear diffuser downforce fix1.4 (12.2023) fixed tyre speed sensitivity",

        "description": "The Hoonigan Racing Division (previously known as the Monster World Rally Team) is a motor racing team that competes in the World Rally Championship, Global RallyCross Championship, FIA World Rallycross Championship and Rally America.The team was formed by Ken Block at the beginning of 2010 as a platform for him to compete at world championship level. The team, sponsored by Monster Energy, ran a 2011-spec Ford Fiesta RS WRC for Block and co-driver Alex Gelsomino at selected events in the World Rally Championship. In 2012, the team entered a second car for Australian driver Chris Atkinson at the Rally of Mexico, though they have not submitted a second entry since.At the Global Rallycross, Block finished 5th in 2012, 3rd in 2013, 2nd in 2014 and 7th in 2015. Block also claimed a third-place finish and a fourth at the 2014 World Rallycross Championship.In 2016, Block will compete full-time at the FIA World Rallycross Championship alongside Andreas Bakkerud, driving all-new Ford Focus RS. The car is built and run by M-Sport, a British motorsport team, who also build and prepare the cars for every rally team and several rallycross teams competing with the Fiesta model",

        "description": "Another prominent figure in the RS Cosworth development was Ruedi Eggenberger of Eggenberger Motorsport. The crack Swiss outfit was selected by Ford to run the Works team and the resulting black Texaco backed cars were the cream of the Touring Car crop. An expert with forced induction motors after success with the turbocharged 240 Volvos, Eggenberger immediately realised the potential of the Sierra RS Cosworth. At the same time he was also very aware that the standard equipment on the cars was not up to the job when it came to ruling the Gp.A roost.Early in the RS Cosworth programme, Eggenberger held discussions with Stuart Turner and Ford Motorsport Europe technical experts on how they would best use the &#39;Evolution&#39; rule within the Gp.A regulations. The end result of these talks was the definition of the specification of the 500 evolution variants of the RS Cosworth, later to be come known as the Sierra RS 500 Cosworth. Essentially, the RS500 was an Eggenberger creation in all but name.Ford then had to build 500 Sierras with the neccessary high performance parts fitted for road use. Only then could the race cars have these parts fitted to unleash the extra performance. Ford struck a deal with long-time partner Tickford to produce 500 very special vehicles. These were to become the RS 500s. Ford were well aware of these rules and at the end of the 5000 run of Sierra RS Cosworths, they produced an additional 500 vehicles that were stored away. It was these cars that went to Tickford to be modified to RS 500 specification.It could have been a very different story, however. Eggenberger themselves were slated to do the conversion from RS Cosworth to RS500, only a lack of time and the fact that the neccessary 500 cars were already in the UK swung it in Tickford&#39;s favour...Many less informed fans of the car think it&#39;s called an RS 500 because it has 500bhp. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth. In Gp. A racing form the cars did indeed develop power levels north of 550bhp, but the roadcars left Tickford with just 224bhp. Still a large amount of power for 1987...! The cars were called RS 500 because of course, there were only 500 made, all in right-hand-drive and all modified by Tickford in the UK. For this reason, all the Group A racing cars aren&#39;t really RS 500&#39;s at all. Most were built from the ground up to be racers, starting out with a special motorsports shell which was seam welded and had an integral rollcage welded in.",

After the abolition of the Group B formula in the World Rally Championship at the end of 1986, manufacturers had to turn to Group A cars and Ford, like most others, found itself without a fully suitable car. The Cosworth was very powerful but, with only rear-wheel-drive, lost out to the four-wheel-drive Lancias and Mazdas on loose-surface events, while the four-wheel-drive XR4x4 had an excellent chassis but an elderly engine producing only around 200 bhp, at least 100 less than the Lancia. For the 1987 season the team ran both, using the XR4x4 on loose surfaces and the Cosworth on tarmac, but the XR4x4&#39;s power disadvantage was too great and from 1988 the team concentrated on the Cosworth alone, and continued to use it until the arrival of the Sierra RS Cosworth 4x4 in 1990.",

In Dutch, they&#39;re out in the open. &quot;Donkervoort,&quot; for example, translates roughly into &quot;Grab your Gouda, because I&#39;m going to murder you in the face.&quot;Actually, it doesn&#39;t. But it might as well. The Dutch-built D8 GTO doesn&#39;t hide its intent to maim. If the car calls to mind a Lotus 7 with &#39;roid rage, that&#39;s because it basically is; Donkervoort got its start in the last century building aluminum-bodied 7 clones. Except that where Lotus&#39;s Colin Chapman preferred things light and simple, Donkervoort likes its cars light and positively, completely, absurdly powerful.For the D8 GTO, the zany Dutchies borrowed the delightful turbo five-cylinder from Audi&#39;s TT RS. (Expensive, small, 4 seconds to 60, sounds like a Group B car with a head cold.) And then Donkervoort gave it 20 more hp because ... why not? At a claimed 1532 lbs, it&#39;s not like the carbon-fiber-bodied two-seater is heavy. If you were somehow able to park two D8 GTOs on the same scale, you still wouldn&#39;t have the mass of a single TT RS.Donkervoort claims that the GTO explodes through the 62-mph mark in 2.8 seconds and hits double that speed in an additional 5.8 seconds. Its maker says aerodynamic drag keeps the car from going any faster than 168 mph, at which point the atmosphere is likely screaming for mercy.EXTRA&#39;s:Raceparts available in extension folder.

        "description": "The last version of the GC WRX was introduced in September 1999. There is no change in the mechanical specifications. Added features are newly designed alloy wheels, color-coded mirrors and door handles, remote central locking, intermittent wipers with a timer and map lights.The WRX has a power rating of 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp).From GC8D came the start of the coupe version of the WRX. It is called the WRX Type R. The coupe was chosen by Prodrive for use in the WRC because it was lighter and stiffer than the sedan, although it carried the same exterior dimensions. It was essentially a two-door version of the WRX Type RA meaning it had DCCD, minimal sound insulation, close-gear ratios and hardened gearbox. This car also has a water-spray nozzle to dampen the top of the intercooler.A brief history:Announced on 22 October 1992, the Impreza was released in Japan in November and offered in either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD) versions and as a four-door sedan or five-door hatchback/wagon (Touring). The car used a shortened version of the Legacy&#39;s floor pan.Subaru adopted the name &quot;WRX&quot; to stand for &quot;World Rally eXperimental&quot; as all WRX versions feature rally inspired technology, including all wheel drive, stiffened suspensions and turbocharged four cylinder engines. Another way to determine the version of a WRX was to look at the chassis code. All WRX sold between 1992 and 2000 have the beginning chassis code of GC8.In 1994, Subaru introduced Subaru Tecnica International (STi badged) versions of the WRX in Japan. These models were upgraded from the standard WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions. The STi versions of the WRX were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers but were only sold in the Japanese market. Compared to the WRX, the STi had mostly mechanical modifications.",

        "description": "The Toyota GR86 GT300 has been revealed in January 2022 at Tokyo Auto Salon, serving as a replacement for team &#228;pr&#39;s #31 Prius PHV GT300.Powered by the same engine from the Lexus RC F GT3 and the Prius PHV GT300 (although this time naturally aspirated), the engine is an 5.4L V8 known as the 2UR-G, equipped the same Hewland 6-speed transmission.As expected, the GR86 GT300 is shorter and significantly more agile than its predecessor, the Prius PHV. Obviously lighter, the car does not have any problems at previously problematic tracks like Okayama. As Manabu &#39;Max&#39; Orido said, the GR86 GT300 is a &quot;cornering machine&quot;, although it is not the fastest on straights that can cause problems on long straights among big groups of other cars.Even though the car is exclusive to Super GT, the frame and the rollcage has been officially approved by the FIA. Only sharing the A-pillar,  the B-pillar, and the top with the production version, the car has been built in house by &#228;pr Racing Constructor.The GR86 has been racing together with both the Prius PHV and the LC500h GT300, it will retain its position as the secondary &#228;pr entry in 2025. Shade Racing and Muta Racing Inging (Now known as HYPER WATER Racing) is also competing with this car, making it a popular choice among Super GT entries next to the Supra GT300, mutually built by &#228;pr.During its more than 3 years of competing, the car has been undergoing several changes, including different aero, wheels, tires and cosmetic changes. The perfect all-rounder of the GT300 category. The mod is mainly based on the the 2024 &#228;pr version.Credits:mhmd - 3D consultantChemFlummi - Physics baseLuca - Soundyank\u0131 - Sound cooperatorozerdogandesign - Shade Racing skinaantonioo - FreeM glove skinsTripple8 - Alpinestars glove skinsTheNuvolari - Original model, porting the car to AC, other skins, small physics tweaks",

        "description": "Friday 4 May, Banbury: Aston Martin is to introduce a new generation of competitive Aston Martin Vantage GT3 and GT4 race cars to customer teams in 2019 that will be based on the critically-acclaimed next generation Vantage road car and the GTE version, set to make its debut in the FIA World Endurance Championship at Spa-Francorchamps this weekend.The two new cars, designed and built at Aston Martin Racing\u2019s headquarters in Banbury, will replace the ultra-successful Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3 and V8 Vantage GT4, currently raced by customer teams around the world. The outgoing examples represent AMR\u2019s most successful racing cars, and they continue to set the standards by winning races and leading championships in GT series around the world 12 years after the first customer car was purchased.In total, 42 V12 Vantage GT3s were built and of those 37 were sold. The car had proved extraordinarily popular with customers and has a glorious roll of honour that includes three British GT Championships (2013, \u201915 and \u201916), the 2017 Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup ProAM title and the Blancpain GT Asian Series. The GT4, of which 124 were built, has a similar pedigree with British GT Championship wins in 2014 and \u201815 and the North European GT4 ProAm title in 2016.Both the new Vantage GT3 and GT4 will feature race-modified versions of the 4.0-litre V8 twin-turbocharged engine used in Aston Martin\u2019s next generation sports car. Moreover, the Vantage GT3 will draw heavily on the design logic used in the development of the Vantage GTE, which was developed in tandem with the road car over the past 18 months.The Vantage GT3 and GT4 will be homologated for racing from the 1st March 2019 and Aston Martin Racing is already taking orders for the cars.Aston Martin Racing Managing Director John Gaw said: \u201cWe are very proud of the heritage we have established as a leading supplier of customer GT cars, with customers racing our cars all around the world. We told the clients who first purchased our GT3 cars seven years ago, that they would be buying a car that would be capable of winning races for years to come. This year we have already proved that with the Aston Martin V12 Vantage GT3\u2019s successes in the British GT Championship. That longevity is something that separates us from other manufacturers. I expect the new GT3 and GT4 to be just as competitive as the cars they are replacing and to remain so for a similar period of time.\u201dDavid King, President, Aston Martin Racing, added: \u201cIn motorsport the qualities you\u2019re most striving for are a competitive edge, driveability and the durability to deliver upon it. We\u2019ve been able to deliver this to our customers for more than a decade with our Vantage GT4 and more recently with the V12 Vantage GT3. In the new Vantage GT3 and GT4, we intend to build on those attributes as well as continuing to deliver the best looking cars in the paddock.\u201dVantage GT4 TECHNICAL DATA SECTION\u2022 Engine: 4-litre turbocharged 8-cylinder\u2022 Power: up to 510 hp (according to BoP)\u2022 Transmission: mechanical (adjustable) differential and magnesium casing\u2022 Gearbox: Sequential six-speed AMG competition gearbox\u2022 Brakes: Competition brake system with adjustable ABS\u2022 Fuel tank: FIA FT3 homologated, 120 litres \u2022 Rollcage: FIA homologated integral structure\u2022 Total weight: 1435 kg (+10kg BoP adjustment)Made by GUERILLA Mods &amp; ChemFlummi3D / Shaders: Benjamin Baron + ChemFlummi Physics / BOP: ChemFlummi + Timo HartmannExtension / Textures: Marcel Erner + ChemFlummi Sound / Management: Timo Hartmann",

Saleen plans to build the cars in Corona, California, beginning in November, and will open them to customer orders once SRO homologates the model for competition.Saleen revealed the turbocharged race car during a press conference and demonstration event held at the Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, and it said it designed its GT4 to compete in various series around the world as well as with SRO. The GT4 concept is based on the racing version of the Saleen 1, which debuted in the 2019 Saleen Cup single-make arrive-and-drive series. The GT4 boasts changes from the standard production Saleen 1, including updates designed to comply with GT4 series specifications.he GT4 concept features updates to its front splitter and fenders, plus a new rear diffuser to improve aerodynamics. Per GT4 specifications, a large rear wing adds downforce. The concept car also offers front and rear ABS and other GT4-specific equipment.With its turbocharged 2.2-liter four-cylinder engine producing 450 horsepower, plus carbon-fiber bodywork covering the mid-engine chassis, the GT4 version has plenty of potential to deliver one rip-roaring fun experience on racetracks.

        "description": "Powered by Toyota RV10 V10 3500 cc N/ADue to rule changes in the World Sportscar Championship for 1992, Toyota was forced to replace their previous series of Group C sportscars, known as C-V, which used the R36V 3.6L twin turbocharged V8. The new rules required a 3.5L naturally aspirated engine to be used. Thus in 1991 Toyota completed their RV10 engines and began early testing.Due to the change in engines, a whole new chassis was also necessary in order to better handle the new V10. Former Tom Walkinshaw Racing designer Tony Southgate was in charge of designing the car that became the TS010, featuring a more aerodynamic and longer body than the C-V series of sportscars. TS010 #002 would be completed towards the end of 1991, and Toyota chose to debut the car at the final round of the 1991 WSC season at Autopolis. The car, driven by Britons Geoff Lees and Andy Wallace and run by half English, half Japanese squad Tom&#39;s, finished 6th overall, only three laps behind the winning Mercedes-Benz.For the start of the 1992 season, Toyota&#39;s main competitors came in the form of the Peugeot 905, which had been launched late in 1990.More racing of TS010: https://www.racingsportscars.com/type/photo/Toyota/TS010.html",

        "description": "The Ford Falcon XR8 (Tickford Falcon XR8 in earlier games) is an Australian race car produced by Ford/Tickford. It is powered by a highly modified 302 cubic inch (5 liter) OHV Windsor SVO V8 which puts out figures of 610BHP and 623lb-ft of torque. Because of this power, the car tends to suffer from small amounts of oversteer when given a spirited drive around a track.This Australian race car first appeared in Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec and has returned in every main game since, with the exception of Gran Turismo Sport.The car appears to be the #5, driven by Glenn Seton, who achieved 5th place in the 2000 V8 Supercars Driver&#39;s Championship. In the 2000 Bathurst 1000, the car was driven by Seton and Neil Crompton to a 13th place finish. At the beginning of the 21st century, the V8 Supercars Championship was the most popular form of motorsports in Australia, more so than Formula 1. The races were contested between two makes, the Holden Commodore (General Motors) and the Ford Falcon.In the second half of the 1990s, the Holden Racing Team dominated the series, but in 2000, the tide began to turn. The reason was because Ford of Australia built a machine specifically intended to usurp the Commodore. The car was called rhe Falcon XR8. It was powered by a 5-liter V8 that pumped out 599 HP. It came mated to a Holinger 6-speed manual gearbox made in Australia, coupled to a 9-in. differential.The V8 Supercars Championship&#39;s main attraction was that the cars were very evenly matched, as a result of strict regulations, which made every race intensely competitive. The cars had to be equipped with identical MoTeC ECUs, as well as imposing limits on the compression ratio and mandating 7,500 rpm rev limiters. Ford&#39;s results in 2000 were much better than in the previous year, but the Falcon XR8 managed only one pole and one win, with three 3rd-place finishes. In Australia&#39;s most popular race, the Bathurst 1000, the Falcon was able to nab pole position with former 500 cc motorcycle champ Wayne Gardner behind the wheel, but the race was won by a Holden.v1.1updated shaders, brakes glow, #5 name/number texture, wiper Animation, shift animation, edited power",

The championship, which was the second Shell Championship Series, began on 11 February at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit and ended on 19 November at the Mount Panorama Circuit after 13 rounds. Titles were awarded for drivers, teams and manufacturers by the series organisers AVESCO (Australian Vee Eight Supercar Company), and the winning driver, Mark Skaife, was also awarded the Australian Touring Car Championship by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport, the 41st time that this title had been awarded.Holden released the new VX Commodore after the VT Commodore. Some Holden teams still ran the VT and some ran the old VS Commodore. Mark Skaife on VT became champion of 2000, 2001 and 2002 V8 series.v1.1updated shaders, brakes glow, wiper Animation, shift animation, edited power",

It is the enhanced form of the 911 GT2 RS - the most powerful street-legal 911 ever. His performance: even more uncompromising. His territory: only the racetrack. Rightly so. Because for us, the new 911 GT2 RS Clubsport is proof that almost anything is possible.Consistent lightweight construction on the bodywork through the use of carbon fiber reinforced plastic for the roof, front lid, front section, doors, rear section and trunk lid and the renunciation of unnecessary weight in the interior. Typical motorsport. Further optimizations of the aerodynamics were tested in the wind tunnel and result in an enlarged rear wing and additional flics on the front end. This ensures increased downforce and brings high stability with rapid load changes.",

It finished the race in 12 hours and 14 minutes; 32 minutes ahead of second place.The 1906 Renault AK GP was equipped with a 13 Litres (12.986 cc) capacity four cylinders engine producing 105 hp and connected to a three speed gearbox; this allowed a claimed top speed of 150 kph (93 mph). The engine had four cylinders of cast iron in two blocks of two on an aluminium crankcase. There were integral cylinder heads and mechanically operated side valves. The engine had a single Renault carburettor. The Radiator was placed against the firewall behind the engine with thermo-syphon cooling.The Renault Type AK was equipped with detachable rim Michelin tyres on the rear wheels, which were mounted on a rim and bolted to the hub (Michelin &quot;jante amovible&quot;) by eight retaining nuts. This allowed to change tyres  in less than three minutes rather than the nasty and long lasting procedure of conventional tyre changing.Source: autoconcept-reviews.com",

Its 600 horsepower naturally aspirated 3.4L V8 propels the 890 kg chassis to over 200mph and its wide front tires and immense downforce allow cornering at up to 4G. On the engineering front, the car has a very wide setup window and performs well under many conditions, allowing drivers to more consistently extract the most from the car versus competitors.The P13c features numerous physics developments courtesy of the AC &quot;Shader&quot; Patch. New thermal models for the brakes and tires, a new aerodynamic model, variable motion ratios in the suspension, engine maps, advanced traction control, and more accurate fuel consumption are only a few of the car&#39;s standout features - none of which previously seen in Assetto Corsa.",

        "description": "&quot;Jaguar&#39;s road-going Group C car, which held the highest top-speed record for a production car in its day.&quot;In 1988, Jaguar showed a prototype of a new exotic sports car at the Birmingham Motor Show. It was called the XJ220, and the car would see production a few years later, becoming one of the fastest machines on the planet. The &quot;220&quot; in its name was a reference to the car&#39;s claimed top speed of 220 mph (354 km/h).The production of the XJ220 was the result of a joint venture with Jaguar Sports and TWR (Tom Walkinshaw Racing). TWR developed the Jaguar Group C race car, and was in charge of its racing team at the time.Under the sleek hood of the prototype car was a naturally-aspirated V12, but the production model came powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 that produced 542 BHP at 7000 rpm, making it more powerful than the twelve-cylinder. And because it was lighter, the car&#39;s handling saw dramatic improvements. The chassis was composed of an aluminum honeycomb and carbon Kevlar composite, which made the entire car very lightweight.In 1993, Jaguar entered a race-prepped XJ220 in the GT-class of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The driving duties were shared by David Coulthard, David Brabham, and John Nielsen. They took 1st in class. But a month later, the XJ220 was disqualified from that race due to an exhaust gas violation, and its victory was nullified.",

        "description": "The Alfa Romeo 33 is not just beautiful, it is sublime! Without a doubt everyone, inside and outside the industry, recognises it as one of the most beautiful cars of all time. The 33 Stradale, first built in 1967, was based on the Autodelta Alfa Romeo Tipo 33 racing car. The car, designed by Franco Scaglione, and built by Carrozzeria Marazzi, made its debut at the 1967 Turin Motorshow. Just 18 examples were ever built.The 33 Stradale is the first production vehicle to feature dihedral doors, also known as butterfly doors. The 33 Stradale also features windows which seamlessly curve upward into the 'roof' of the vehicle. The car has aluminium body on aluminium tubular chassis. As a result of being built by hand, each model differs from the others for some details.The car has 13-inch Campagnolo magnesium wheels, the fronts eight and the rears nine inches wide; there are Girling disc brakes on all four corners, the rear ones are inboard. Suspension is like in mid-1960s race car with upper and lower control arms in front and double trailing arms in the rear, along with substantial antiroll bars.The race-bred engine bore no relation to the mass-produced units in Alfa's more mainstream vehicles. The engine is closely related to the V8 of the Alfa Montreal, albeit with smaller capacity and in a much higher state of tune.The car takes 5.5 seconds to reach 60 mph (96.6 km/h) from a standing start and has a top speed of 260 km/h (160 mph). In 1968 it was the fastest commercially available car in the standing kilometre with the time of 24.0 seconds measured by German Auto, Motor und Sport magazine.",

        "description": "The new Giulia Quadrifoglio represents more than the most powerful Alfa Romeo ever created for road use. It\u2019s the convergence of engineering and emotion that can only belong to a brand as fabled as Alfa Romeo. Here's to a sports badge born more than a century ago, that still stands for something totally original today: a passion for motoring unlike any other. Visceral. Energetic. Technological. Crafted.The heart of Giulia Quadrifoglio is a gasoline-powered 2.9 V6 bi-turbo engine with 90\u00b0 opposed cylinders. The engine delivers 510 hp and 600 Nm of torque between 2500 and 5000 RPM.Made entirely of aluminum, it is extraordinarily powerful, yet lightweight. This new engine is developed with Ferrari expertise.The Giulia Quadrifoglio is more than a showcase for the best power\u2013to\u2013weight ratio in its class, it's a study in how to use that power. The perfect 50:50 weight distribution creates optimal balance and showcases the advantage of a rear\u2013wheel\u2013drive layout in a front-engine vehicle. By pairing rear\u2013wheel drive with Giulia Quadrifoglio\u2019s front\u2013mounted, all\u2013aluminum 6\u2013cylinder engine, the Alfa Romeo engineering team was able to carefully distribute weight throughout the chassis.The Giulia Quadrifoglio is equipped with an innovative system that ensures the optimal distribution of torque to the two rear shafts, thanks to an electronically controlled differential featuring two clutches. This results in greater traction and more secure handling, even at high speeds, on curves, and on any type of roads. The Giulia Quadrifoglio is the only sedan in the world with an Active Aero splitter: a carbon appendix positioned under the front bumper. At speeds of over 100 km/h it opens thanks to two actuators controlled by the Alfa\u2122 CDC (Chassis Domain Control), providing additional stability by increasing downforce, especially when taking high-speed curves.",

The MultiAir electrohydraulic valve management system reduces fuel consumption by controlling intake air directly via the inlet valves (without using the throttle) and reduces polluting emissions by using extremely precise combustion control.It's fitted with the Alfa Romeo's latest-generation, six-speed, double dry-clutch ALFA TCT transmission. As in the Alfa Giulietta, this new transmission offers automatic or sequential manual shifting, either via the gear lever or steering-wheel mounted paddle shifters, and can be reconfigured for different driving scenarios via the Alfa D.N.A. driving mode selector, which also tunes throttle response, engine performance, power steering assistance and the suspension depending on the mode.",

This in brief is the new Alfa Romeo 4C, a driving machine without compromise that beckons drivers to take to the road or track to experience the thrill of driving it. The Alfa Romeo 4C is essentiality and light weight, a car where everything has been designed to provide total driving pleasure. That same essentiality shaped its design. The car expresses a natural beauty that results from a perfect blend of function and form. Its layout and size immediately brings one of the most beautiful coup\u00e9s of all time to mind, the Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale. Like the legendary 33 Stradale, the 4C is designed to meet extreme mechanical and functional requirements. Its body aerodynamically covers the engine and chassis with clean and essential surfaces.This vehicle quite simply screams Alfa. Its sports car soul creates unique driving sensations, both on the road and when racing, where velocity and transverse accelerations offer even the most expert driver unrivalled driving thrills: from 0 to 100 km/h in just 4.5 seconds flat, 258 km/h of top speed, deceleration peaks in the range of 1.2 g and lateral acceleration peaks over 1.1 g. All this is also achieved with a balanced weight distribution, with 40% on the front axle and 60% on the rear.",

        "description": "The concept behind the Audi R18 e-tron quattro is unprecedented in LMP sport, and its realization a pioneering achievement. In the first development step, the engineers from Audi Sport and their partners investigated a wide variety of solutions. These included a parallel hybrid, where both drive systems propel the rear wheels. After weighing up considerations such as traction, handling characteristics, packaging and weight distribution, they ultimately decided to separate the drive systems by axle \u2013 the combustion engine drives the rear wheels permanently, and the electric drive propels the front wheels on demand.On the R18 e-tron quattro, part of the braking energy benefits the motor generator unit (MGU) that is located at the front axle. Their two permanently excited synchronous machines convert the recovered energy into direct current through power electronics. This current drives a flywheel energy storage system positioned on the left inside the cockpit.When the speed exceeds 120 km/h, the energy is called up from the storage system again. Converted back into alternating current by the power electronics, it then supplies the MGU\u2019s two electric motors. These jointly feed more than 160 kW to the front wheels via single-stage planetary gears; the central control unit keeps the revs and torque in line with the conditions prevailing at the rear wheels. The racing car temporarily becomes a quattro with four driven wheels.",

        "description": "The Audi R8 LMS is the first race car to have been specifically developed by Audi for customer teams. Maximum reliability, ease of use for teams and drivers and, obviously, competitiveness were the focal topics guiding the development of the mid-engine sports car. The result: The GT3 version of the R8 LMS ultra and its US version for the GT Daytona (GTD) class are fast and reliable. Numerous successes and championship titles have been providing impressive proof of this since 2009.The perfect base for both race car versions stems from road cars. More than 50 per cent of the production parts of the Audi R8 V10 are also used for racing by Audi Sport customer racing. The production V10 engine with FSI gasoline direct injection has such good genes that it has been adopted for the race cars almost unchanged. This financially benefits the Audi customer teams as well. The first inspection is due only after 10.000 race kilometres, followed by the first rebuild after 20.000 kilometres.Audi Sport customer racing is just as much a part of Technical Development (TE) at Audi as Audi Sport is. Armin Plietsch, Head of Technology at Audi Sport customer racing, can draw on the entire know-how of the Audi Group and the huge wealth of experience from the DTM, WEC and other racing series. Before switching to the GT project at Audi Sport he was involved in the DTM programme in a leading role. Details such as the Audi R8 LMS ultra's rear wing suspended from the top, the small winglets at the front, as well a glance into the interior, reveal the close kinship between the customer sport race cars and Audi's successful DTM and LMP1 race cars.",

Just like the other manufacturers, Audi used the lenient homologation requirements to create a new rally car. All the car maker needed for homologation was a production run of a mere 200 cars.Blomqvist's spectacular, sideways driving style suited the Sport quattro perfectly. By flicking the tail out, the Swede overcame the natural understeer of the nose-heavy Audi. He won five of the twelve rounds and was crowned the 1984 World Champion. Mikkola and Roehrl also won a round, which was enough to clinch the constructor's trophy as well.",

This ensures that the Audi TT cup that tips the scales at1,125 kilograms is a lightweight and extremely agile car.The Audi TT cup car uses the 2.0 TFSI from the Audi TTS. The four-cylinder engine delivers 228kW (310hp) in the production model and accelerates the TTS from 0 to 100km/h in 4.7 seconds. By means of a so-called Push-to-pass function, the drivers can briefly boost the engine's output by 22kW (30hp) for overtaking maneuvers by pushing a button on the steering wheel. A blue lamp in the windshield indicates the boost activation. LEDs in the rear side windows show how many times the driver can still use the additional power. The number of available boosts is defined by the regulations.Power is transmitted to the front wheels via a direct-shift dual-clutch transmission. The six-speed S tronic, which has been specifically tuned for use in racing, is operated by shift paddles on the steering wheel. Accordingly, the Audi TT cup only has two pedals, used for acceleration and braking.",

        "description": "The basis our engineers had to start with when developing the racing version of the BMW M235i Racing was exceptionally good, said BMW Motorsport Director Jens Marquardt. The production models from the BMW M Performance Automobiles range are already incredibly sporty. Because of this, we did not have to make many modifications in order to get the BMW M235i Coup\u00e9 up and running as a racing car. BMW Motorsport can look back on a long tradition of allowing ambitious teams and drivers an affordable way into motor racing \u2013 and of offering them an absolutely competitive car. That was the case recently with the BMW M3 GT4, and that is now being superseded with the BMW M235i Racing.The motorsport genes are also easily recognisable in the production version of the BMW M235i Coup\u00e9, courtesy of the aerodynamically optimised body design. It is propelled by the most powerful petrol engine developed so far for a BMW M Performance Automobiles, a six-cylinder in-line engine with M Performance TwinPower Turbo technology. With a capacity of 2,979ccm, the racing version is capable of generating 333hpMotorsport-specific driving aids such as ABS, DSC and traction control ensure that the motorsport newcomers can also handle the BMW M235i Racing surely and safely. The car also comes with mechanical limited-slip differential, which is also available for the BMW M235i Coup\u00e9 in the original BMW Parts range. The racing car is also fitted with features such as the FIA-certified safety cell and the modern safety tank. On top of this come components from the BMW M Performance Parts range, such as the rear and front spoilers, diffusor and carbon wing mirrors.",

        "description": "When it comes to endurance racing, Corvette has been the benchmark of success for nearly 15 years, says Jim Campbell, U.S. vice president, Performance Vehicles and Motorsports.Many of the architectural and aerodynamic features of the C7.R are based on equivalent components and technologies from the 2015 Corvette Z06, including a new, aluminium frame. As before, the race car and the Z06 will share the same, production-based aluminum frame. By leveraging advanced manufacturing materials - such as laser welding, Flowdrill-machined fasteners and a GM-patented aluminum spot-welding process - the production structure is significantly stronger than its predecessor. For Corvette Racing, this equates to a race chassis for the C7.R that is 40 percent stronger than the outgoing C6.R.The addition of direct fuel injection to the Corvette Z06 will enable the technology to return to a Corvette race car for the first time since the end of the GT1 era in 2009. It promises greater efficiency, which can make a significant difference in long-distance endurance racing such as Daytona and Le Mans through fewer time-consuming pit stops.The aerodynamic strategies of the Corvette Stingray came directly from the Corvette C6.R - including the forward-tilted radiator, functional hood and front-quarter panel vents, and rear transmission and differential cooling intakes. The Z06 and C7.R take that aerodynamic foundation to the next level, sharing aggressive strategies for increased cooling and aerodynamic downforce, including similar front splitters, rocker panels, and front- and rear-brake cooling ducts.",

        "description": "And only a Corvette with the perfect balance of technology, design and performance can wear the iconic Stingray designation.The Corvette Stingray features an estimated 450 horsepower and 610 Nm of torque, and it is able to accelerate from 0-60 in less than four seconds and achieve more than 1g in cornering grip. This model takes advantage of lightweight materials, advanced manufacturing techniques and technology transfer from the Corvette Racing program to produce an ideal 50/50 weight balance and to deliver a world-class power-to-weight ratio.The technologically advanced foundation is an all-new aluminum frame structure that is 57 percent stiffer and 45 kg lighter. The greater torsional rigidity reduces unwanted noise and improves ride and handling.This model features main rails composed of five customized aluminum segments, including aluminum extrusions at each end, a center main rail section and hollow-cast nodes at the suspension interface points. Each segment is tuned \u2013 varying in thickness from 2mm to 11mm \u2013 tailoring the gauge, shape and strength properties to optimize the requirements for each frame section with minimal weight.The innovative use of materials includes a standard carbon fiber hood and roof panel, as well as underbody panels created with carbon-nano composite technology, an advanced blend of traditional composite material and carbon fiber, which allows lighter underbody panels without a loss of strength or stiffness. Fenders, doors, rear quarter panels and the rear hatch panel are made with lighter-density Sheet Molded Compound.The seven-speed manual incorporates rev-matching technology for upshifts and downshifts. This driver-selectable feature can be easily engaged or disengaged via paddles on the steering wheel. The seven-speed is used with a new dual-mass flywheel and dual-disc clutch, which deliver greater shift quality and feel through lower inertia. The transmission with the Z51 Performance Package includes specific close-ratio gearing for more aggressive driving.",

It made its public debut at the annual pre-season Ferrari press conference in January 1962, and was the only front-engined model on display, with its monoposto and sports racing counterparts all having a mid-engine configuration.The 250 GTO was the ultimate expression of the Ferrari 250 GT car. It was equally at home on the road or track \u2013 perhaps the last dual-purpose road/race car produced \u2013 and has achieved legendary status amongst aficionados of the marque. With only a relatively small production run of thirty-six cars, and with many of the examples produced having a great racing pedigree, it has become one of the icons of Ferrari's production history, with a revered position in collectors' circles.",

        "description": "Announced by Enzo Ferrari in September 1983, and unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1984, the GTO (also unofficially known with the 288 prefix) sparked off a wave of enthusiasm. The legendary name, the stunning styling by Pininfarina, the engine with its seemingly inexhaustible power (2.8 litres and 8 cylinders) and the widespread use of composite materials made the GTO the closest thing to a racing car.To meet customer demand, 272 were built instead of the planned 200: all were sold before production began.The 288 appellation refers to the total cubic capacity of the engine and number of cylinders, 2.8 litres with 8 cylinders. Obviously, the \"GTO\" model name was a retro touch referring to the legendary 250 GTO of the early sixties, to which it was intended to be the spiritual successor in GT racing.",

        "description": "The 63rd single-seater designed and built by Scuderia Ferrari to take part in the 2017 Championship is born out of a regulation change that is without precedent in this category of motor sport. In the past, regulations generally went in the direction of slowing the cars down. However, in the year 2017 the rule changes went in the opposite direction, meaning the cars can have more aerodynamic downforce and more mechanical grip.There are several differences between the 668 project and Ferraris from the recent past: the lengthened nose and the arrow-shaped wing are a consequence of the regulations, as is the obvious fin on the engine cover and more complex aero appendages ahead of the air intakes on the sidepods.The layout of some of the mechanical components on the hybrid power unit has been revised, while other areas maintain a similar layout to the 2016 car.",

This design allows the engineering of very light body panels and creates at the same time a main reference structure during the car assembly and maintenance.Front and rear suspensions are double wishbone with pushrod and adjustable anti roll-bar. The suspension layout has been developed based on the experience gained with the P4/5Competizione on the Nordschleife.All the targets were achieved by Scuderia Cameron Glickenhaus' SCG003C during the QualifyingRace that took place at the N\u00fcrburgring on 12th April, 2015.Both registered cars were qualified for the 24 Hours \"Top 30\", while all SCG drivers were qualified to the race that will take place on 16th and 17th May, 2015.Noise issues were finally solved while the overall car reliability was proved, despite an electrical fault that prevent \"Macchinadue\" to compete in the race.At the start of the race, Manuel Lauck brought Macchinauno to 2nd place and was able to keep this position until the car was black flagged as too loud. The noise issue was definitively solved at the pit box, by the fitting of new mufflers.Macchinauno then advanced from 61th to 13th position and won the SP-X Class.Lap time during the race was always at the level of top cars, confirming the car's performance and endurance potential.",

The Superleggera makes its entrance to continue the success of its predecessor, launched in 2007, of which Lamborghini produced and sold no less than 618 in just one year.Compared with the already lean Gallardo LP 560-4, the weight of the Gallardo Superleggera has been trimmed by 70 kilograms. The super sportscar from Sant'Agata Bolognese boasts a dry weight of no more than 1340 kilograms - the lightest road-going model in Lamborghini's range, and a new arrival in one of the most exclusive market niche segments. One key factor is the exterior and interior components made from carbon-fiber. Carbon-fiber is ideal for the manufacture of sportscars as its use allows for weight reduction and improved mechanical features. The car's performance is thus enhanced thanks to a better weight-to-power ratio and reduced total mass, which means that CO2 emissions are also lower. Lamborghini has been at the forefront in this material's application for many years, and now the brand is extending its leadership even further.The V10 power unit with 5.2 liters of displacement generates 570 bhp in the Gallardo Superleggera. This puts the weight-to-power ratio of the new top model at only 2.35 kilograms per HP and guarantees breathtaking performance. The Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera handles the dash from zero to 100 km/h in 3.4 seconds and flies past the 200 km/h mark only 10.2 seconds later, ultimately reaching 325 km/h. The engine with &quot;Iniezione Diretta Stratificata&quot; gasoline direct injection also boasts an impressive degree of efficiency. Its fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have been reduced by 20,5 percent compared to the previous model.The Gallardo Superleggera is an uncompromising driving machine. Its running gear, with its mighty braking system, has a dedicated and exceptionally precise set-up. The Lamborghini Gallardo LP 570-4 Superleggera brings a whole new meaning to the term &quot;super sportscar&quot;.",

A bi-turbo highly modified engine that is capable of doing more than 850bhp on pump fuel and more than 1200bhp on race fuel and full turbo boost. The chassis has also been tuned accordingly with stiffer springs and dampers all around. Nevertheless you better watch out when you decide to give full boost. The performance is simply out of this world and the car can spin all four tyres in curva grande at monza in 6th gear... Remember, you need to brake 1 to 2 km before every turn as it takes some space to slow down from ultrasonic speeds!",

        "description": "Lamborghini Miura P400 SV The Lamborghini Miura is a sports car that was produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1966 and 1973. The car is widely considered to have instigated the trend of high performance, two-seater, mid-engined sports cars. At launch, it was the fastest production road car available.The 12 cylinder, double overhead camshaft naturally aspirated engine has 2 valves per cylinder and a volume of 3.9 litres. It produces power and torque figures of 385 bhp at 7850 rpm and 399 Nm (294 lbft/40.7 kgm) at 5750 rpm respectively.This power is transmitted to the wheels through a 5 speed manual gearbox. With a claimed kerb weight of 1293 kg, the Lamborghini Miura P400SV can dispense with the 0-100 km/h benchmark in 4.50 seconds and the kilometre from rest in 23.2 seconds. Its maximum speed claimed is 290 km/h or 180 mph.The SV can be distinguished from its predecessors from its lack of eyelashes around the headlamps, wider rear fenders to accommodate the new 9-inch-wide rear wheels and Pirelli Cinturato tires, and different tail lights. The problem with excessive front end lift at speed was also reduced somewhat in the later model car, but not eliminated entirely.  150 Lamborghini Miura P400 SVs were produced.",

        "description": "The Lotus 72 was a Formula One car designed by Colin Chapman and Maurice Philippe of Lotus for the 1970 Formula One season.This was yet another innovative design by Chapman featuring inboard brakes, side mounted radiators in sidepods, as opposed to the nose mounted radiators which had been commonplace since the 1950s and an overhead air intake. The overall shape of the car was innovative too, resembling a wedge on wheels which was inspired by the earlier Lotus 56 gas turbine car, and the layout taken from the Lotus 63 four wheel drive project testbed. The shape made for better air penetration and higher speeds. In a back-to-back test with the Lotus 49, the 72 was 12 mph faster with the same Cosworth engine.Chapman's efforts produced one of the most remarkable and successful designs in F1 history. Taking the stressed engine layout technique from the Lotus 49 and adding advanced aerodynamics produced a car that was years ahead of its rivals. To begin with however, problems with the handling of the car had to be overcome, due to a lack of 'feel' caused by the anti-dive suspension geometry - which was designed to prevent the nose of the car dipping significantly under braking - and the anti-squat set-up at the rear, which was supposed to stop the car 'squatting down' under acceleration. Once the suspension was modified, there were no further problems. The car caused a sensation amongst the media and fans, with many people clamouring to see the remarkable car in action.",

Maserati's design signature is clearly visible on the sides: the three iconic air vents on the front wings, the trapezoidal C-pillar with the &quot;Saetta&quot; logo and the large, frameless door windows. The rear is dominated by the very tapered back window and streamlined shape, both typical of a high-performance sports car.At a technical level, the Levante's chassis is designed to combine the outstanding on-road performance typical of every Maserati with unrivalled handling even on very low-grip surfaces and an excellent off-road performance and ride. The new SUV boasts a high level of content as standard, with all versions featuring: sophisticated electronic suspension with controlled damping and air springs, which can be set on several levels, &quot;Q4&quot; intelligent all-wheel drive and 8-speed automatic transmission specially calibrated for the brand's new SUV.",

The production of the RX-7 model (FD-3S) came to an end in August 2002.The Spirit R series is available in three models: the Type-A, a two-seater with a five-speed manual transmission; the Type-B, a four-seater with a five-speed manual transmission; and the Type-C, a four-seater with a four-speed automatic transmission. All three models are equipped with common interior and exterior features, such as BBS-manufactured 17-inch wheels, red brake calipers, and interior panels with a special soft coating, while each model shows off its own equipment to make a difference from the other.The Type-A Spirit R is a two-seater model fitted with the Recaro-made exclusive red full bucket seats. These lightweight seats reduce the overall chassis weight of the vehicle by approximately 10 kg. Braking performance is enhanced through the use of large drilled type ventilated disk brakes for all four wheels and high rigid stainless mesh brake hoses. The Type-A Spirit R model is the ultimate RX-7, boasting the most outstanding driving performance in its history.",

        "description": "Because of its nature, the rotary engine is able to run at higher speeds without suffering the detrimental forces of a common engine. This means the owner is not forced to focus on extensive modifications to preserve engine's lifetime. The main steps are remapping the engine, replacing the original turbo system with a bigger unit, improving the air filter to have a higher flow (very important for rotary engines), exhaust pipe and, of course, installing a big rear wing because the rear is really light at high speeds.",

        "description": "Like every McLaren, the performance of the 570S Coup\u00e9 is breathtaking. It combines, as its name suggests, a power output of 562bhp with lightweight construction to give a class leading power-to-weight ratio of 434PS per ton. The 570S accelerates from 0 to 100km/h in 3.2 seconds, while 200km/h is reached in just 9.5 seconds with the pace not letting up till the car reaches a top speed of 328km/h.The McLaren design team has created a shape of beauty highlighted by details such as the rear flying buttresses that increase downforce as well as adding grace, and complex door tendons that direct additional air to cool the mid-mounted V8 engine.The Sports Series features an evolution of the 3.8-litre V8 twin turbo engine, named M838TE, with 30 percent of components bespoke to the new model. Engineered by McLaren, it produces 562bhp at 7,400 rpm, and 600Nm of torque at 5,000-6,500 rpm. Power is delivered through a seven-speed SSG transmission, and transferred to the road through the rear wheels. This power is brought under control with standard-fit carbon ceramic brakes.The unique carbon fiber MonoCell II chassis has been newly designed with more of a focus on day-to-day usability, offering improved ingress and egress from the cabin. It is incredibly strong and stiff yet weighs less than 80kg, offering optimum levels of protection. This lightweight structure, and the use of aluminum body panels, contributes to a dry weight of as low as 1,313kg, almost 150kg lighter than its closest competitor.",

Built around the same lightweight carbon fiber MonoCell chassis found in the 650S, the 650S GT3 offers a number of enhancements that ensure it is optimized on the track.A very aggressive carbon fiber splitter has been added to the front to increase downforce, while larger intakes at the front allow for better cooling. The sides of the car have also been reworked, with optimized air intakes. In the rear, a large fixed carbon fiber wing stands out among the modifications made to the 650S for the GT3 iteration. Below the wing is a large rear diffuser and reworked bodywork.Inside, the driver sits in a fully FIA-approved McLaren GT-developed race seat, which is fitted with a six-point race harness. In front of the driver is a bespoke motorsport digital dash directly behind the 650S GT3 steering wheel, modelled after the McLaren Formula 1 wheel design.Of course, safety is a main concern when it comes to designing race cars, and that is why McLaren put a huge emphasis on this with the 650S GT3. Already mentioned in this article is the carbon fiber MonoCell chassis, with the addition of the FIA-approved rollcage that has been redesigned and is lighter than the one used in the 12C GT3.Power comes from the award-winning 3.8-liter V8 twin turbo &#39;M838T&#39; engine, producing around 500 hp, roughly the same power as the 12C GT3. Mated to the engine is an all-new six-speed sequential motorsport transmission.",

        "description": "The McLaren F1 GTR was a racing variant of the McLaren F1 sports car first produced in 1995 for grand touring style racing, such as the BPR Global GT Series, FIA GT Championship, JGTC, and British GT Championship.  Following the success of the 1995 season, McLaren set forth to upgrade the car to remain competitive, especially against the threat of newer sports cars appearing such as the Ferrari F50 GT (which was withdrawn quickly enough) and Porsche 911 GT1. They were assisted by BMW Motorsport, who at the time decided to use their connection to McLaren to enter sports car racing by running their own race team with F1 GTRs. Among the modifications were an extension of the front and rear bodywork, including a larger splitter attached to the front of the car. The bodywork was also modified to allow it to be removed more quickly for easier repair. The car's normally stock gearbox was modified to include a lighter magnesium housing and more robust mechanicals. These modifications allowed for the weight of the GTR to be lowered by 38 kg. Although equipped with a restricted engine that produced less power than the road car, slower on an entire lap than the 1997 long-tail version due to the significantly lower downforce (the 1997 model relied on high-speed cornering much like prototypes of the 2000s), the F1 GTR of 1996 was the fastest variant in terms of straight line speed. The car hit 330 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans in 1996, which is 13 km/h faster than the 1997 long-tail F1 GTR and even 6 km/h faster than the 1996 Porsche GT1.McLaren F1 GTRs have been so successful that raced internationally until 2005 when the final race chassis was retired.

        "description": "The astonishing new McLaren P1\u2122 has a clear goal - to be the best driver's car in the world on road and track. To achieve this objective, McLaren is using all of its 50 years of racing experience and success, especially in the fields of aerodynamics and lightweight carbon fibre technology. The result is a car that has an unprecedented amount of downforce for a road vehicle. Similar levels to a GT3 racing car and yet with even greater ground effect. This downforce not only boosts cornering and braking performance. It also helps balance, stability and driveability at all speeds. The best driver's car in the world must also have exceptional straight-line performance and instant throttle response. To deliver this, the McLaren P1\u2122 uses an innovative IPAS petrol-electric powertrain comprising a substantially revised 3.8-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine, coupled to a single electric motor, collectively known as M838TQ. Combined power output is 916 PS. As important as absolute power is the electric motor's ability to provide instant torque, making the powertrain superbly responsive. Top speed is electronically limited to 350 km/h, with the 0-100 km/h standing start acceleration taking less than three seconds. The McLaren P1\u2122 will power from rest to 200 km/h in less than seven seconds, and on to 300 km/h in less than 17 seconds - a full five seconds quicker than the McLaren F1.",

A host of changes have been made, and the car has been thoroughly re-engineered from the ground up to ensure the McLaren P1\u2122 GTR achieves its target of being the ultimate drivers' car on track.The front track of the McLaren P1\u2122 GTR design concept has been widened by 80mm over the McLaren P1\u2122, and is coupled with a more aggressive GT-style front splitter. Reprofiled low-temperature radiator ducts seamlessly flow into the leading edge of the aggressively flared front wheel arches, while the bodywork is \"shrink-wrapped\" around the carbon fiber MonoCage chassis behind the front wheels, cleaning the flow of air along the car's flanks.The profile of the McLaren P1\u2122 GTR design concept remains as dramatic as ever, hunkered down on to the race-prepared suspension with a fixed ride height, lower than the standard car. The snorkel air intake, inspired by the design of the original McLaren F1, is still present within the roof structure of the carbon fiber MonoCage chassis.At the rear, a large, twin-element wing is mounted on dramatic carbon fiber pylons which extend around the rear of the bodywork. This fixed-height wing is fitted with a hydraulically operated Drag Reduction System (DRS) to boost acceleration performance, and has been honed to provide increased levels of downforce compared to the road car, working with the active aerodynamic flaps located ahead of the front wheels.The road legal McLaren P1\u2122 stows the rear wing within the bodywork, but with the fixed height wing, and therefore no pistons or moving mechanical parts, the bodywork of the McLaren P1\u2122 GTR design concept behind the engine bay is now a smooth, flowing surface, feeding clean air below the wing and over the back of the car.Below the rear wing sits the exposed, centrally mounted exhaust, which is an all-new design, developed exclusively for the McLaren P1\u2122 GTR. Made from inconel and titanium alloy, the system maximizes the aural characteristic of the higher output 3.8-litre twin turbo V8 engine to maintain, and further emphasize, the McLaren sound. The design of the exhaust has also changed, with a straight cut twin-pipe setup now used in place of the single-exit exhaust.",

But who would have thought that it would also acquire a reputation as a compact sports car over the years and after several engine and equipment refinements?The 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II - celebrated its world premiere at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1990. The EVO II stood out for its bodywork modifications designed to reduce drag still further and to raise downforce at the front and rear axles. Particularly distinctive and eye-catching features were the large rear airfoil and the wheelarch flares. The EVO II caused quite a stir, quite literally. Within three months, a small series of 502 units was produced to obtain homologation for motor sport.The car may have been ever so well developed and designed - for the motor sport teams, it was no more than the basis for additional modifications. And there was plenty of scope for the latter: engine output was boosted to well over 300 hp and the car's weight was reduced to less than 1,000 kilograms, resulting in a top speed in the range of 300 km/h. It is therefore not surprising that the EVO II was a highly successful competitor on the racetrack - as borne out by the DTM driver's title clinched by Klaus Ludwig in 1992.",

Its matt paintwork in designo selenite grey magno covers the muscular contours like a second skin. As an alluring contrast, yellow exterior highlights create sophisticated effects in counterlighting. From whatever the viewing angle: this racing car from Affalterbach already makes a mighty impression at standstill, and embodies sheer power.The widened body, the large air inlets, the diffuser and the enormous rear aerofoil \u2013 numerous features from motorsport give the Mercedes-AMG GT3 a decidedly dynamic appearance. At the same time it avoids any sign of unnecessary showmanship: all modifications to the body are in the interests of maximum downforce and aerodynamic efficiency, for best results on the racetrack. The specially incorporated features also improve the effective cooling of components subject to high thermal loads.To keep the vehicle weight as low as possible, the body is mainly of carbon-fibre: the bonnet, doors, front wings, front and rear aprons, side walls, side skirts, diffuser, boot lid and rear aerofoil are made from this particularly lightweight yet extremely strong material. As in the roadgoing version, the vehicle structure of the GT3 consists of a likewise extremely lightweight yet rigid aluminium spaceframe. With numerous detailed improvements, systematic implementation of the &quot;AMG Lightweight Performance&quot; strategy has resulted in an even lower kerb weight than that of the SLS AMG GT3.The AMG 6.3-litre V8 engine, with additional improvements for the new racing car, ensures the fulminating power already familiar from the SLS AMG GT3. Low operating costs, long service intervals, the user-friendly technology and, not least, the great reliability of this naturally aspirated, high-revving AMG engine were the reasons for staying with this concept for the customer sports segment. Dry sump lubrication obviates the need for an oil sump, allowing the V8 engine to be installed low down in the chassis and well behind the front axle.",

Beside replacing the black colour scheme for its national plain silver scheme, reducing AEG as a minor sponsor, the older M117 5.0L turbocharged V8 engine was upgraded to the M119, which replaced steel heads with new aluminium. The C9 was able to win all but one race in the 1989 season, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans.  The car had two variations. The LM version, depicted here, had reduced downforce for less drag and was able to achieve great top speeds at the long straights of the Le Mans circuit.During qualifying for Le Mans, the C9 recorded a speed of 398 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight, a record. Mercedes driver Jean-Louis Schlesser would end up taking the driver's championship that season.  The M119 engine could use just 50% of total boost and still produce more than 710bhp with low fuel consumption, very important for the 24 hours race. Alternatively you can crack the turbo boost to 100% and get a power output of more than 900bhp but at the expense of reliability. The car had very high levels of downforce, even in the LM low drag version. The downforce was generated by a very big diffuser and under tray, but this also caused the car to be very pitch sensitive. Very stiff suspension was needed to make the car more stable aerodynamically, but the combination of the suspension setup with the diffuser stall at low speeds and the impressive amounts of torque of the turbo charged engine at low revs, make a car easy to spin at slow turns. Careful throttle application is advised.",

        "description": "Though it has now been 45 years since the arrival of the original 240Z, its influence remains strong in the sports car world and in the design of the current generation 370Z Coupe. The iconic shape, formed by the combination of a short wheelbase, wide track, low center of gravity and fluid silhouette, is as instantly recognizable today as it was in 1970.Even more than racing-inspired aerodynamic bodies and driver-oriented cockpit-style interiors, at its core NISMO is all about performance. To that end, the 370Z NISMO includes a potent 350-horsepower 3.7-liter DOHC V6 engine with Variable Valve Event and Lift Control (VVEL). The 370Z NISMO's enhanced engine power and acceleration is provided through use of an exclusive H-configured exhaust system design and muffler tuning, along with optimized ECM (Engine Control Module) calibration, to help create 18 horsepower more than a standard 370Z. Torque is rated at 276 lb-ft.",

In its first year it competed vigorously in events such as the SUPER GT GT300, the Super Taikyu and the British GT Championship and it attained a number of podium finishes. Furthermore, in 2013 it was the Blancpain Endurance Series Pro-Am class championship vehicle.Using the same VR38DETT engine used in mass production vehicles, it has a maximum output of more than 550ps, generating a maximum torque of over 65.0kgf/m. With only a 6-speed sequential spec gearbox equipped with a semi-automatic paddle shift, the drive system is a FIA regulation approved rear wheel drive. Even more than the 2013 model, which has already demonstrated its speed in the GT3 race world, reliability has been improved and a total reduction in running costs has been achieved. ",

        "description": "1999 has seen the introduction of the new Skyline R34 GT-R, with a wealth of history behind it and an enviable reputation to live up to. A 'super-evolution' of the model it replaced, the R34 GT-R is more advanced in every respect. Its body is stiffer and its aerodynamics package is further refined, and in V-spec features front and rear carbonfibre diffusers under the car, and dual wing adjustable aerofoil on the bootlid. Among the many technical refinements under the bonnet are twin ceramic intercooled Turbochargers, which effectively eliminate Turbo-lag. There is also more torque and better power delivery.A six-speed Getrag transmission now delivers the engine's output to the wheels. Improvements have been made to the ATTESA four-wheel drive system, which features E-TS, or Electronic Torque Split. This gives the driver the entertainment of a 100 per cent rear-wheel drive car, together with the traction and safety of a 50:50 four-wheel drive system when conditions demand it. This is further backed up by 'intelligent' electronic limited-slip differential. Refinements to the Super HICAS rear-wheel steer system include an electronic yaw-rate Feedback Control System for even more precise control of the rear wheels in extreme situations.Quicker Turbo response has also been achieved through the use of new Turbochargers. Power is fed through a new six-speed close ratio Getrag gearbox. The basic engine goes back some nine years and was first developed for racing. In racing specification the engine comfortably produces upwards of 507bhp.",

        "description": "The third, redeveloped generation of the mid-engine sport coup\u00e9 718 Cayman has a more striking, athletic and efficient appearance than its predecessors. And although it features -- for the first time -- four-cylinder flat engines with turbocharging instead of six-cylinder engines as in the previous generations, the performance has actually improved significantly.The 718 Cayman S model delivers 350 hp (257 kW) with a displacement of 2.5 litres. The tremendous torque of the new engine promises driving fun and agility even at low revs. The 2.5-litre engine of the 718 Cayman S features a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG), a technology hitherto used exclusively in the 911 Turbo. It delivers up to 420 Nm (an extra 50 Nm) to the crankshaft at engine speeds between 1,900 and 4,500 rpm. For the driver this means even better torque in all engine speed ranges. The 718 Cayman with PDK and optional Sport Chrono Package sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds. The 718 Cayman S with Porsche-Doppelkupplung (PDK) and optional Sport Chrono Package sprints from zero to 100 km/h in 4.2 seconds. The top speed is 285 km/h.In terms of its driving dynamics, the 718 Cayman S follows in the tracks of the classic 718 race cars. Thanks to their outstanding agility, the historic mid-engine sports cars won numerous races in the 1950s and 1960s such as the Targa Florio and Le Mans. Lateral rigidity and wheel tracking have been improved in the completely retuned chassis; springs and stabilisers have been designed to be firmer and the tuning of the shock absorbers has been revised. The steering, which has been configured to be ten per cent more direct, enhances agility and driving fun. The rear wheels, which are one-half of an inch wider, in combination with the redeveloped tyres result in an increased lateral force potential and hence in greater cornering stability.On account of the car\u2019s greater driving performance capabilities, stronger brake systems are now in use with 330-millimetre brake discs in front and 299-millimetre discs at the rear. The 718 Cayman S, on the other hand, uses the four-piston callipers of the 911 Carrera combined with six-millimetre thicker brake discs.",

        "description": "In 1960, Porsche continued its long list of victories, which began with the legendary Porsche 550 Spyder race car in 1953, with an exceptional vehicle: the Type 718 RS 60. In response to a new FIA race car rule, which demanded they more closely resemble standard production vehicles, the displacement of the RS 60 developed on the basis of the 718 RSK was not only increased to 1,600 cc, it also gained some rather unusual features for a race car, namely a larger windshield, functional hood and luggage compartment located at the rear, behind the four-cam four-cylinder engine which now produced 160 hp. Externally, the new Spyder was recognisable by its deep, rounded front and a backward tapering bulge at the rear.   From the outset, the 718 RS 60 became a racing big shot, recording the sports car manufacturer's greatest successes to date, particularly in long-distance events: at its very first outing, the 12h of Sebring, the Gendebien/Herrmann and Holbert/Sheckter driver teams achieved the top two spots. Overall victory at the 44th Targa Florio in 1960 also went to Porsche, when Joakim Bonnier and Hans Hermann crossed the finish line with a lead of more than six minutes over the three-litre Ferrari. Second place in the 1000 kilometres of N\u00fcrburgring completed its triumphant run. With the Swiss racing driver, Heini Walter, at the wheel, the 718 RS proved its climbing qualities by consecutively winning the third and fourth European Hill Climb Championships in 1960 and 1961.",

        "description": "When choosing the most exciting 911 of all time, the Porsche 911 Carrera RSR would come out on top. Based on the 911 Carrera RS homologation model, the RSR was built in 1972 as a Group 4 race car, whose performance far exceeded that of its predecessors. The front and rear wings were five centimetres wider, and the oil cooler was located under the car's front-end which visually highlighted the power of the 55 911 Carrera RSRs produced. The rear of the vehicle had a six-cylinder engine with increased displacement, whose performance was increased to 330 hp at 8,000 rpm, thanks to dual ignition and larger valves and cylinders. The Porsche works team competed in the 1973 Manufacturers' World Prototype Championship with the 911 Carrera RSR. In the last Targa Florio World Championship race ever held, the works cars achieved an historic overall victory (M\u00fcller/van Lennep), which marked the end of the great road race era. More GT victories followed at the 6h of Vallelunga and the 1000 kilometres of Dijon and Spa. Customer teams also entered motorsport events with the 911 Carrera RSR, winning the 24h of Daytona in 1973, as well as the European and German Rally Championships, among others. For Porsche, this heralded the start of a new era of customer racing. ",

        "description": "The 911 GT1 was developed for works and customer appearances in GT races during the mid-1990s, making its racing debut in 1996. The GT1 was the first ever 911 to have a water-cooled mid-mounted engine, which as well as balanced axle load distribution also offered aerodynamic benefits. Behind a Joest Team TWR Porsche WSC 95, the new GT race car immediately achieved a double victory in the GT1 category at Le Mans in 1996, along with second and third place in the overall ranking. In 1997, both 911 GT1s dropped out of Le Mans due to technical problems encountered just before the end of the race. A year later, a revised version of the 911 GT1 competed at Le Mans, which was the first time Porsche entered a sports car with a carbon fibre chassis. Thanks to its CFK monocoque, reworked front axle suspension and battery and generator weight savings, the 911 GT1 98 weighed around 50 kilograms less than its predecessor. The engine output was increased by a further 50 hp, thanks to its modified engine management system. Another new feature was the three-disc racing clutch made of carbon fibre. As a fitting tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Porsche sports car brand, the 911 GT1 recorded a double victory for the Zuffenhausen-based manufacturer at the 24h of Le Mans in 1998.",

        "description": "With the 911 GT3 RS, Porsche is once again breaking down the barrier between sports cars and race cars. It is equipped with the maximum degree of motorsport technology that is currently possible in a street-legal 911. With a lap time of seven minutes and 20 seconds, the 911 GT3 RS even beats the historic record value of the Carrera GT super sports car of just under seven minutes and 29 seconds on the North Loop of the N\u00fcrburgring.Motorsport expertise is the reason for this superior performance. The 911 GT3 RS is powered by a four-litre six-cylinder engine with 500 hp (368 kW) of power and 460 Newton metres of torque, combined with a specially developed PDK transmission. The engine, which has the largest displacement and most power of any naturally aspirated engine with direct fuel injection in the 911 family, accelerates the high-performance sports car from zero to 100 km/h in 3.3 seconds and to 200 km/h in 10.9 seconds.The 911 GT3 RS is a masterpiece of intelligent lightweight design. For the first time, the roof is made of magnesium; carbon fibre is used for the engine and luggage compartment lids, and other lightweight components are made of alternative materials. In addition, the lightweight roof lowers the sports car's centre of gravity which improves its excellent lateral dynamics. The body comes from the 911 Turbo, and it signifies its status as nearly a race car driving machine with its RS-specific aerodynamic add-on parts. The front spoiler lip, which extends nearly to the road, and the large rear wing reinforce its dominant look. Another characteristic is the unique front wheel arch air vents that extend into the upper section of the wings \u2013 just as in purebred motorsport cars. They increase downforce at the front axle. The chassis of the 911 GT3 RS has been tuned for maximum driving dynamics and precision. Rear-axle steering and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus with fully variable rear axle differential lock increase agility and dynamics, and the wider front and rear track widths enable a superior roll stability. In addition, the 911 GT3 RS comes with the widest tyres of any 911 model as standard. The results: even more agile turn-in characteristics and even higher cornering speeds. ",

The four-litre, extremely light aggregate features direct fuel injection as well as a rigid valve drive and is characterised by outstanding efficiency. The new 911 RSR did its debut at the Daytona 24-hour race in January 2017.Shift paddles on the steering wheel actuate the sequential six-speed gearbox with a magnesium housing, which delivers power to the 31-centimentre-wide rear wheels. The changeover to the new engine generation is now complete. After the 911 GT3 R and the 911 GT3 Cup, the spearhead of Porsche GT racing cars is now also powered by the same cutting-edge six-cylinder boxer engine family.In the 2017 season, the factory is expected to run the new 911 RSR at 19 outings which equates to more than 140 hours of racing. With two factory-entries, Porsche will tackle the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) including the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as the American IMSA Weathertech Championship. With the look of the body wrapping, the 911 RSR is striking out in a new direction: For the first time, the GT racer bears the new factory design that has further developed the clear and dynamic design language of Porsche Motorsport.

        "description": "The Porsche 917/30 Spyder owed its outstanding performance to its twelve-cylinder twin-turbo engine. Unlike the strictly regulated European motorsport series, the CanAm series placed no restrictions on technicians' ingenuity in terms of weight or displacement limits. The team supporting the Porsche race engine designer, Hans Mezger, was therefore able to dig deep into its box of tricks to ensure that the twelve-cylinder turbo engine of the 917/30 steadfastly produced 1,100 to 1,400 hp and a maximum torque of 1,210 Newton metres, thereby guaranteeing exceptional acceleration: from zero to 100 km/h in just 2.4 seconds, a mere 5.4 seconds to the 200 mark and only 11.3 seconds to reach a speed of 300 km/h. And above all, the turbocharger of the Porsche 917/30 Spyder proved to be highly reliable, even on twisting circuits. Porsche driver Mark Donohue beat his McLaren and Chevrolet rivals so comprehensively, that the race car received the equally rare and coveted title of \"unbeatable\". Only the CanAm series rules prevented the fast, reliable Porsche 917/30 Spyder from entering the race again in 1974. But the Porsche 917/30 Spyder was much talked about even after the 1973 race season. In 1975, Mark Donohue set a new world lap record in Talladega, Alabama, in an aerodynamically optimised 917/30. The absolute top speed of the American's fastest lap was 385.85 km/h. Today, the race car can be admired in the Porsche Museum in Zuffenhausen, where it is considered a highlight of the museum's collection. The 917/30 also regularly tours the world as a brand ambassador as part of the \"Rolling Porsche Museum\".",

        "description": "The 918 Spyder embodies the essence of the Porsche idea: it combines pedigree motor racing technology with excellent everyday utility, and maximum performance with minimum consumption.The 918 Spyder reveals its close links to motorsport in a variety of ways. It has been designed, developed and produced by Porsche engineers who build race cars, in cooperation with series production specialists. A great deal of insight gained from the development of Porsche race cars for the 24 hours race in Le Mans in 2014 was thus integrated into the 918 Spyder \u2013 and vice versa. Also, many parts of the super sports car come from manufacturers who have a proven record as suppliers for motorsport vehicles.The main source of propulsion is the 4.6-litre, eight cylinder engine that produces 608 hp (447 kW) of power. The engine is derived directly from the power unit of the successful RS Spyder, which explains why it can deliver engine speeds of up to 9,150 rpm. The V8 engine is coupled to the hybrid module, which comprises a 115 kW electric motor and a decoupler that serves as the connection with the combustion engine. An additional electric motor with 95 kW drives the front axle. Because of its parallel hybrid configuration, the 918 Spyder can be powered at the rear axle either individually by the combustion engine or electric motors or via both drives jointly, thus giving it a total power of 887 hp (652 kW). The sprint from 0 to 100 km/h is performed within 2.6 seconds, and the top speed is reached at 345 km/h.The car has an unladen weight of approximately 1,640 kg, an excellent low weight for a hybrid vehicle of this performance class. The drivetrain components and all components weighing over 50 kg are located as low and as centrally as possible within the vehicle. This results in a slightly rear end biased axle load distribution of 57 per cent on the rear axle and 43 per cent on the front axle, combined with an extremely low centre of gravity at approximately the height of the wheel hubs, which is ideal for driving dynamics. All of this serves to give the 918 Spyder a superior performance on the racetrack. As the first vehicle to boast global road homologation, the 918 Spyder has conquered the 20.6-kilometre lap around the N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife in less than seven minutes. Achieving a time of exactly six minutes and 57 seconds, the super sportscar shaved an incredible 14 seconds off the previous record.The 918 Spyder continues a long tradition of super sports cars at Porsche: as technology platforms, as the driving force behind both car emotion and car evolution and as the ultimate sports cars of their decades.",

        "description": "In 1976, the Porsche engineers developed a race car based on the 911 Turbo, which was set to dominate the long-distance races of the FIA Group 5 Manufacturers' World Championship: the Porsche 935. The highlight of this development project was the legendary Porsche 935/78 from 1978 \u2013 the most powerful 911 of all time. The differences between this powerhouse - named \"Moby Dick\" on account of its wide, long-tailed body - and previous models were a modified frame, aerodynamically enhanced body and right-hand drive, among other things. With the aim of improving the performance and durability of the engine, the Weissach engineers developed a power unit that was destined to leave the competition standing. As previous models had encountered problems with cylinder head maintenance, these were now simply welded together. A compromise also had to be found for the cooling. So water cooled the heads, and air cooled the cylinders. With the newly-introduced four-valve technology, the six-cylinder horizontally opposed engine relied on two intercooled turbochargers. Increasing the displacement to 3,211 cm\u00b3 resulted in brute power of 845 hp. Due to its continued dominance, Porsche withdrew from the long-distance World Championship in 1978, meaning that \"Moby Dick\" saw only a handful of outings. At Le Mans, the race car managed an incredible 366 km/h on the Mulsanne Straight, but in the end its drivers, Manfred Schurti and Rolf Stommelen, only finished in eighth place, due to technical problems. The great successes of the Porsche 935/78 were not achieved until 1978 onwards, as part of the private Kremer team. ",

With innovative turbo flat engines, an advanced chassis with an even greater spread between performance and comfort it is exceedingly well-equipped for this. Thanks to more than four decades of experience with turbo engines \u2013 in both motor racing and production sports cars \u2013 the new engines in the 911 Carrera S offer improved performance, even more emotional driving pleasure and higher efficiency.420 hp (309 kW) of power at the rear are waiting to be unleashed and converted into sporty propulsion. The greater power of the 911 Carrera S results from turbochargers with modified compressors, a specific exhaust system and tuned engine management. The new engines are also characterized by significantly increased torque (60 Nm in each case) with maximum torque of 500 Nm delivered constantly from a low 1,700 rpm up to 5,000 rpm in both cases, thus ensuring excellent driving performance. At the same time with a maximum speed of 7,500 rpm the new engine generation clearly exceeds the top speeds of conventional turbo engines \u2013 underscored by the typical sonorous Porsche engine sound.The new 911 also boasts impressive performance: The 911 Carrera S with Porsche-Doppelkupplung (PDK) and Sport Chrono Package performs its showcase discipline \u2013 the sprint from zero to 100 km/h \u2013 in just 3.9 seconds. This means that it is the first 911 in the Carrera family to undercut the magic four second mark. And the top speed has also increased further: the 911 Carrera S now reaches a mind-blowing 308 km/h.All in all, the 911 Carrera S again sets the benchmark for driving dynamics of all-round sports cars, further increasing the spread between everyday comfort and circuit performance.",

Top speed: 330 kmh.From a technical point of view, the 911 Turbo S is just as well equipped as the 911 Turbo. In terms of performance, however, the specification is even more elaborate.Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) provides active roll stabilisation and enhances the neutral handling further. The Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB) improves braking performance. New 20-inch 911 Turbo S wheels have a central locking device \u2013 technology derived directly from motor racing.The design of the 911 Turbo S is accentuated in a number of ways: on the outside, tailpipe trim in black chrome and SportDesign exterior mirrors with their V-shaped base",

        "description": "As the sports car among sport utility vehicles (SUVs), the Cayenne Turbo S offers a lot of room for a lot of driving fun. With high performance and typical Porsche design DNA, it represents the top version of the sporty SUV model series. The Cayenne Turbo S is characterised by a high level of performance readiness, uninterrupted forward thrust and an ability to handle any driving situation. Its 4.8-liter V8 biturbo engine develops 570 hp (419 kW) and 800 Nm (590 ft lb) of torque. A chassis that is tuned for maximum driving dynamics and packs a wide range of control systems also makes the Cayenne Turbo S a genuine top athlete. It accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in 4.1 seconds, with a top speed of 284 km/h, and can turn a lap of the North Loop of the N\u00fcrburgring in 7:59.74 minutes. The Cayenne set a new record for SUVs here, and it also proves that every Porsche is a genuine sports car \u2013 even in this vehicle segment.The Cayenne Turbo S also underscores its position as a top athlete in its chassis systems. Its standard Porsche Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) include 420 mm front brake discs and ten-piston calipers. The rear brakes have 370 mm discs and four-piston calipers. The active roll stabilization system, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) proactively reduces side tilt when driving through curves early on. Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV Plus) increases dynamic handling and stability by making specific brake interventions at the right or left rear wheel \u2013 this noticeably improves steering into curves and steering precision. The active hang-on all-wheel drive system Porsche Traction Management (PTM) permanently drives the rear wheels while offering fully variable power distribution to the front wheels. Some advantages of the interplay between all systems: excellent driving dynamics and traction as well as a high level of agility at any speed.",

        "description": "The Cayman GT4 marks the first time Porsche has introduced a GT sports car based on the Cayman model range which has components of the 911 GT3. A lap time of 7 minutes and 40 seconds on the North Loop of the N\u00fcrburgring positions the Cayman GT4 as the new benchmark at the top of its market segment. The engine, chassis, brakes and aerodynamic design of the Cayman GT4 are configured for maximum driving dynamics. It is powered by a 3.8-litre flat-six engine with 385 hp (283 kW), which is derived from the 911 Carrera S engine. Its power is always transmitted by a six-speed manual gearbox with dynamic gearbox mounts. The Cayman GT4 accelerates from zero to 100 km/h in 4.4 seconds; its top speed is 295 km/h. The chassis \u2013 which features a 30 mm lower body position and a generously sized brake system \u2013 consists nearly entirely of components from the 911 GT3. As a mid-engine sports car and a prime example of driving dynamics in its class, it follows the conceptual tradition of such cars as the 904 Carrera GTS, 911 GT1, Carrera GT and 918 Spyder. Hence, the Cayman GT4 makes a clear statement that Porsche continues to promote radical two-door sports cars in the future \u2013 sports cars that are developed at the Motorsport department in Weissach.",

It's a visual promise of thrilling performance. Bi-Xenon main headlights with dynamic cornering lights provide optimum illumination of the road \u2013 and therefore a high level of safety.The Macan Turbo also stands out thanks to its front spoiler lip, the design of which is inspired by the 918 Spyder. The direction indicators and position lights have been integrated in such a way that they appear to hover inside the side air intakes. Below them are the LEDs of the fog lights. The sideblades are painted in the exterior color of the body. SportDesign sideskirts underline the powerful profile. Another typical feature of the Turbo is the 'Macan turbo' logo on the rear hatch.Impressively, the 3.6-liter twin-turbo V6 engine delivers an enormous power output of 400 hp. The sprint from 0 to 100 kmh is completed in a mere 4.6 seconds. Top speed is 266 kmh. Those aren't simply bare numbers, but a compelling statement in terms of performance \u2013 and efficiency.",

Its 4.0-litre V8 engine develops between 5,750 and 6,000 rpm and reaches a peak power of 404 kW (550 hp). At just above 3,000 rpm the engine already breaks through the 250-kW (340 hp) threshold \u2013 pure power from a mid-range of engine speeds. Its maximum torque of 770 Nm is available between 1,960 and 4,500 rpm \u2013 pure force from very low revs. The eight-cylinder accelerates the Panamera Turbo with Sport Chrono Package from a standstill to 100 km/h in 3.6 seconds up to a top speed of 306 km/h.Porsche is also taking the steering precision and handling of sports cars into the class of Gran Turismo cars with rear axle steering \u2013 which is also new and has been adapted from the 918 Spyder and 911 Turbo.That way, the Panamera Turbo delivers the performance of a genuine sports car.

        "description": "The 86 is a series of grand tourer sports coup\u00e9s jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru and solely manufactured by the latter. The 86's engine is a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine that uses Subaru's horizontally opposed boxer engine layout. Toyota added their D-4S injection system which uses both direct and port injection. The engine has a 12.5:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke of 86 mm that results in 200 bhp at 7,000 rpm and 205Nm of torque at 6,000 rpm.The 86 was designed around a front-mounted boxer engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, inspired by the Toyota AE86. The flat architecture of the boxer engine allows it to be mounted low, dropping the center of gravity down, resulting in sporty handling characteristics. The exterior design of the 86 was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT's extremely low-to-the-ground profile and long, sleek hood.It is sold worldwide under three different brands with respective model names:- Toyota 86 in Asia, South Africa, South America and Australia; GT86 in Europe; both of the preceding names in New Zealand; FT86 in Jamaica;- Subaru BRZ worldwide;- Scion FR-S in the US and Canada.",

The Supra was available with both a manual and automatic transmission, and came standard with 4-wheel-independent suspension and 4-wheel disc brakes.With the exception of minor styling updates, the next major change occurred in 1993, when the Supra entered the realm of &quot;supercars.&quot; Available in both Turbo and non-Turbo guise, the new Supra was a radical departure from Supras of old. Performance was now the name of the game, and many weight saving measures were employed -- Toyota went so far as to equip the vehicle with hollow carpet fibers and make the rear spoiler (optional on Turbo models) hollow. The Turbo model was hailed by all major magazines as a true worldbeater. With 320hp, the vehicle was capable of 0-100 km/h sprints in under 5 seconds, and carried on to an electronically-limited top speed of 250 km/h. This was the highest level of performance and the strongest commitment to performance Toyota had ever placed in one vehicle.",

With the the KTM X-BOW R the product range of the super sports car with the carbon monocoque includes the most powerful version yet developed. The R is the result of concentrated further development of this spectacular lightweight sports car. In the rear of the R is a 300 h.p 2.0 Liter TFSI engine from Audi with a maximum torque of 400 Nm and this ensures an unbelievable driving experience both on and off the racing circuit, because naturally the KTM X-BOW R is homologated for use on the road.",

        "description": "The Lancia Fulvia is an Italian car introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 1963 by Lancia and produced until 1976. Fulvias are notable for their role in motorsport history, including winning the International Rally Championship in 1972. On testing it in 1967, Road and Track summed up the Fulvia as a precision motorcar, an engineering tour de force. Named after Fulvia Flacca Bambula, an aristocratic Roman woman and wife of Mark Antony.One element that was new was the narrow-angle V4 engine. Designed by Zaccone Mina, it used a narrow angle and was mounted well forward at a 45 angle. The engine is a DOHC design with a one camshaft operating all intake valves and another operating all exhaust valves. The very narrow angle of the cylinders allowed for use of a single cylinder head.The fulvia manages remarkably well on power giving its displacement. I believe the first car to get 100hp per litre was the ferrari 250 gto, and that was only 10 years back. The engine in the fulvia is sometimes overlooked, because of how great the whole car is, but it really is one of the most remarkable details. ",

        "description": "1985 was a year in which Martini Racing needed to show the potential winning capabilities of the LC2 in order for Lancia to continue to fund a project that had seen limited success thus far. The cars were further revised and were running on Michelin radial tyres. The season opened with an LC2 taking pole position at Mugello by 1.7 seconds ahead of the factory Porsche. Although the pole position car&#39;s engine did not last, the other team car finished fourth. For the 1000 km of Monza, the LC2s were nearly four seconds ahead of the closest Porsche in qualifying,and led the race early on. However, while Patrese and Nannini were in third place and on the same lap as the leaders, a tree fell across the track and caused the race to be stopped early. On pole once again at Silverstone, one of the LC2s was in the lead of the race until a wheel bearing failure in the closing laps forced Nannini to pit, forfeiting the lead. Although the LC2s did not take pole at Le Mans, they lead the race early. Reliability issues again forced the team to drop out of the lead. They eventually finished the race in sixth and seventh places. A fuel pump failure also dropped the team out of contention at the Hockenheimring.The team was competitive throughout the race at Spa, with the LC2 of Wollek, Patrese, and Mauro Baldi leading the factory Porsche towards the end of the event. The Lancia were leading when the race organisers chose to end the race out of respect for driver Stefan Bellof who had been killed in an accident earlier in the event.Even with the shortened race, Lancia were able to celebrate their first victory over the factory Rothmans Porsche team. The following event, the 1000 km of Brands Hatch, saw the LC2s leading en route to a potential win, only to hit one another and finish third and fourth.Once again unable to challenge Porsche in the championships, Lancia chose not to participate in the final two rounds. However they still earned second in the Teams Championship, just ahead of the privateer Joest Racing Porsche.",

        "description": "The Lister Storm was a homologated GT racing car manufactured by British low volume automobile manufacturer Lister Cars with production beginning in 1993. The Storm used the largest V12 engine fitted to a production road car since World War II, a 7.0 L Jaguar unit based on the one used in the Jaguar XJR-9 that competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Due to the high price of the vehicle at &#163;220,000, only four examples were produced before production of the road-going Storm ceased. Only three Storms survive today, although the company continues to maintain racing models. The Storm was the fastest four-seat grand tourer during the 1990s and early 2000s.The bored and stroked two-valve V12 engine generated a maximum power output of 546 hp; 553 PS (407 kW) at 6,100 rpm and 790 N\u22c5m (582.7 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 3,450 rpm. The car weighed 1,664 kg (3,668.5 lb), and was capable of accelerating from 0\u201397 km/h (60 mph) in 4.1 seconds.The Lister Storm GTS debuted at the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans as a competitor in the GT1 class, going up against cars such as the McLaren F1 GTR, Ferrari F40 LM, Jaguar XJ220S, and the Porsche 911 GT2. The car, driven by Geoff Lees, Rupert Keegan, and Dominic Chappell, did not perform well, failing to finish due to gearbox failure after 40 laps.In 1996, the team decided to give the Storm an early test for Le Mans by entering a lone Storm in the 24 Hours of Daytona but failed to finish. Even with this letdown, the team pushed on towards Le Mans with the Storm GTS. The car was able to improve on its disappointing start by finishing the race in 1996, although the car finished in 19th place, 59 laps behind the winner. Lister decided after Le Mans that they would enter the Storm GTS into the BPR Global GT Series, debuting in the fifth round at the N&#252;rburgring. The car was then entered at the Suzuka 1000km. Every race that the Storm GTS entered for the rest of the season failed to result in a finish.For 1997, Lister realized that the Storm GTS was too slow in comparison to some of the newer GT1 class competitors, such as the Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR and Porsche 911 GT1. The Storm was therefore redesigned, with a longer and more aerodynamic front end added to the existing car. This car was referred to as the Storm GTL. The car debuted at the 24 Hours of Daytona, where it managed to take 19th place overall and fourth in its class. Later that year, for Le Mans, two new Storm GTLs were entered, but neither of them was able to finish, with both cars out of the race by lap 77. Later in the year, a Storm GTL would travel to the United States to participate in the final two rounds of the FIA GT Championship at Sebring and Laguna Seca. The car failed to finish both races.1998 saw the team again attempt Daytona, but again they suffered problems early on, and did not finish. With these difficulties, the team was not selected for entry in that year&#39;s 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the team did not compete anymore that year, the team instead concentrating on redesigning the Storm.For 1999, the Storm reappeared. The car had lost the aerodynamic bodywork seen on the GTL, instead using a more stock front end. The team announced they would participate in the full FIA GT Championship season under the new GT2 class rules. After a poor start, the team managed to take fourth place at Hockenheimring, a mere two laps behind the winning pair of Chrysler Viper GTS-Rs. This was followed by a third place at Zolder, and finally, a second place at Donington, with the Lister finishing a mere 26 seconds behind the winning Viper. These successes brought Lister into a tie for fifth place overall in the teams championship at the season&#39;s end.Going into 2000, Lister was more upbeat about their possibilities. Chrysler-Oreca had officially left the championship, eliminating a challenge from a factory team. Thus, Lister would face competition only from privateers. With this, Lister proved their capabilities by winning the first race of the season at Valencia. Lister would follow this up with four more wins during the season, all claimed by drivers Julian Bailey and Jamie Campbell-Walter. With these victories, Lister claimed the teams championship. At the same time, Lister competed in the British GT championship both as a factory team, as well as with a customer car for Cirtek Motorsport. The two teams were able to take nine victories.Returning as champions to FIA GT, Lister continued into 2001 with two factory cars. Although Lister was able to take four victories over the year, the team had to settle for third in the teams championship, being beaten by Larbre Competition and Carsport Holland&#39;s privateer Vipers. A similar situation occurred in 2002, with Lister managing three victories but only able to take second in the teams championship, again beaten by Larbre.In 2003, Lister was joined in FIA GT with a customer Storm, run by Creation Autosportif. The Lister factory team managed only a single win, yet were still able to take second place in the teams championship. Creation was not far behind, with a fourth-place finish in the championship, after gaining a second customer Storm. At the same time, Lister began work on a new project, the Storm LMP which would bring the marque back to Le Mans. This was, therefore, the beginning of the decline of the Storm GT.For 2004, Creation Autosportif would take over as the main competitor in FIA GT, with the factory squad appearing only at selected races. Creation managed to take only eighth in the teams championship after the team decided to move to Le Mans Prototypes as well, while the factory squad was only able to score a single point all season. Lister would continue to attempt to campaign the car into 2005, but were only able to gather enough points for 10th place in the teams championship. Following 2005, the factory officially retired the cars to concentrate on the Storm LMP.In 2006, French squad Red Racing would purchase a Storm for the FFSA GT Championship. The team would make one attempt at the FIA GT Championship, but failed to make it beyond seven laps in the race at Paul Ricard. As of 2007, there were no Storms racing.",

        "description": "After a difficult first year for Lotus in the 3 litre formula, Chapman went back to the drawing board and came up with a design that was both back to basics, and a leap ahead. Taking inspiration from earlier designs, particularly the Lotus 43 and Lotus 38 Indycar, the 49 was the first F1 car to be powered by the now-famous Ford Cosworth DFV engine after Chapman convinced Ford to build an F1 powerplant.The 49 was an advanced design in Formula 1 because of its chassis configuration. The specially-designed engine became a stress-bearing structural member (seen first with the H16 engine in the Lotus 43 and BRM P83), bolted to the monocoque at one end and the suspension and gearbox at the other. Since then virtually all Formula 1 cars have been built this way.",

        "description": "The Lotus 98T was a development of the Lotus 97T of 1985. Of the four chassis built three were assigned to Ayrton Senna, now in his second year with Team Lotus, and one to team mate Johnny Dumfries.Designed by G\u00e9rard Ducarouge and Martin Ogilvie the chassis featured a lower monocoque than the 97T as a result of a regulation change stipulating a reduction in fuel capacity to 195 litres. The powertrain consisted of the new Renault EF15B turbo V6 engine driving through a six speed Hewland gearbox.The EF15B was to appear in two forms, the standard engine and the D.P. engine which featured pneumatic valve springs for the first time. At the end of the season Renault introduced the revised EF15C which in addition to the D.P. valve gear also boasted common rail fuel injection and much revised water cooling through the cylinder head reducing the likelihood of pre-ignition (detonation). Power figures for this period of F1 history are largely speculative as most engine manufactures freely admitted that their test beds would not have a sufficient power rating to measure the 1.5 litre turbos output at above 4 bar boost. It is generally accepted that the Renault EF15 produced between 1,200 bhp (890 kW) and 1,300 bhp (970 kW) at 5.5 absolute bar boost.",

Its unique design ensures a chassis so stiff that it takes 27,000 Nm to twist it just one degree.With its state-of-the-art, lightweight chassis, the Evora's handling is truly remarkable. From its functional aerodynamics, to its mid-engined construction giving optimum weight distribution, through to its race-derived components, such as Bilstein dampers, Eibach springs and AP Racing track tuned braking system - Lotus' motorsport expertise feature in its design and engineering.",

Translated as 'dark' from Italian, the name 'Scura' reflects the stealth character of this already fierce looking Lotus and its stunning soft-feel matt black paint finish. Limited to just 35 cars globally, this Exige evokes a desire to 'indulge your dark side'.Whilst there is no doubt that this is a visually stunning car, the Exige Scura is not just about its looks - it begs to be taken on track, and its racing character encompasses poise, power and technology to make it a serious contender. Equipped with the most powerful engine in the Exige range and generating 260PS, the Exige Scura achieves a top speed of around 245 km/h and reaches 0-100 kmh in just 4.1 seconds.",

        "description": "Hudson Hornet is a full-sized automobile that was manufactured by Hudson Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan from 1951 until 1954, when Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson merged to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Hudson automobiles continued to be marketed under the Hudson brand name through the 1957 model year. The Hornet rode on Hudson\u2019s unique \u201cstep-down\u201d chassis, which invited passengers to step into its recessed floor pan rather than climb onto a floor level with the chassis rails. This innovative bit of engineering lowered the Hornet\u2019s center of gravity, increasing handling performance. The car was very attractive to racers, especially when combined with Hudson\u2019s factory optional 210hp \u201c7X\u201d engine. This big-bore flathead engine was often lauded as the most powerful six-cylinder in the world, potent enough to directly compete, and win, against the likes of Oldsmobile and its big overhead-valve V-8 on the NASCAR circuit. The Hornet\u2019s standard engine was the 308ci six, fed by a single two-barrel carburetor until 1953 when the Twin-H dual-carb option increased horsepower to 170hp. Following Hudson\u2019s 1955 merger with Nash to form AMC, attempts to rejuvenate the declining Hornet model included a trendy 1950s body style complete with a tri-tone paint scheme and copious chrome \u201cV\u201d emblems. Despite these efforts, a meager 3,100 units were sold in its final year \u2013 a disappointing demise for the once \u201cFabulous\u201d Hudson Hornet.",

The official name of the series changed throughout the years, however it has generally been known as the World Sportscar Championship from its inception in 1953. The World Sportscar Championship was, with the Formula One World Championship, one of the two major world championships in circuit motor racing.In 2012 the World Sportscar Championship was revived and renamed as the World Endurance Championship.Feel free to use my car in your own championship.Credit:Polyphony Digital: model, textures3d works: ltkPBR: ltksound: kunosliveries: r0r0GP, RadRandi and PR0JECTNR56",

From its conception, the 12C has been designed around the driver with a carbon chassis. Every one of the 12C's components is bespoke, and there to either enhance performance or contribute to the unmatched driving experience.Now, the 12C takes carbon innovation to a new level. It is based on a unique one-piece moulded carbon chassis: the MonoCell, which weighs just 75kgs (165lbs). The MonoCell concept required it to provide the perfect combination of occupant space, structural integrity, light weight, and relatively low construction costs. And the ideal chassis from which to deliver ground-breaking efficiency and performance in the sports car market.",

        "description": "You are about to journey into Farcreek Engineerings newest creation.Until now, if you wanted to have some bouncy fun with mates in the dirt, there were only a few options. You could rent SuperStadium Trucks. They look fun, but a solid rear axle? Seriously, in 2021? 600 hp is for babies anyway. So you look into more perforrmance and find Trophy Trucks. An all round better package for sure, and with 900 bhp also much faster, But my god do they look like Tupperware on lifted supension. You aren&#39;t vain, but you are distinguished. So you look into more design, you find Monster Trucks, and realised you&#39;ve gone too far. Here at Farcreek Engineering we see you. You&#39;re not one to compensate. You are comfortable in your skin, and you just want to have fun on the weekends, and look good doing it. A strong package, on a good looking body. Well good on ya! Farcreek Engineering has built exactly what you need. The 2021 MegaTruck has a perfect 50/50 weight distribution for excellent handling and to help you take the big jumps with ease. 1,001bhp under your right foot will propel you forwards. The retro modern design goes with any occasion and is already a timeless classic. What about innovations such as the brake light integrated aero tunnels? Or brake lights on the front, so everyone can see that you&#39;re not braking. Cherry on the pie: unique magnetic invisible suspension. The Farcreek MegaTruck. Only positives with no negatives. Except for the enourmous weight. You can&#39;t have it all, who cares. The Farcreek MegaTruck.",

They took the names &quot;Citro&#235;n Berlingo First&quot; and &quot;Peugeot Partner Origin&quot;.In 2010, the Citro&#235;n Berlingo First Electrique and the Peugeot Partner Origin Electric were launched. These two electric vans were powered by the Mon&#233;gasque firm Venturi, which assembled them in Solesmes, Sarthe.In Argentina, Peugeot launched an off-road version of its Partner, called Partner Patag&#243;nica. This model had various names when it was sold across Europe in the 2000s, including Partner Ushua&#239;a Grand Raid, Partner Escapade, Partner Grande Escapade, Partner VTC, Partner Indiana, and others.From 2013, the Berlingo and the Partner were discontinued in Europe. Both LCV and passenger versions continued their career in South America, where they are still produced years after.Passenger vans Berlingo Multispace and Partner Patag&#243;nica received an update in June 2021. More parts of both vehicles are now manufactured locally. It means they now have barn doors (already manufactured locally for LCV Berlingo and Partner), replacing their tailgate that was imported from Europe.The Berlingo and the Partner got a minor facelift in January 2023. The Berlingo adopted an updated Citro&#235;n logo (until there it still used the sharp logo from before 2009) and a new grille, in plastic. The Partner adopted the same grille and lost the piece of chrome around its front logo.",

        "description": "A revised version, featuring a new instrument cluster, as seen in the Peugeot 206, redesigned interior and front end, was released in September 2002 (Berlingo I / Partner I).During 2004, there was a minor facelift, including changes to the grille and light clusters.After the launch of the second generation Berlingo and Rifter, the first generation models stayed offered. They took the names &quot;Citro&#235;n Berlingo First&quot; and &quot;Peugeot Partner Origin&quot;.In 2010, the Citro&#235;n Berlingo First Electrique and the Peugeot Partner Origin Electric were launched. These two electric vans were powered by the Mon&#233;gasque firm Venturi, which assembled them in Solesmes, Sarthe.In Argentina, Peugeot launched an off-road version of its Partner, called Partner Patag&#243;nica. This model had various names when it was sold across Europe in the 2000s, including Partner Ushua&#239;a Grand Raid, Partner Escapade, Partner Grande Escapade, Partner VTC, Partner Indiana, and others.From 2013, the Berlingo and the Partner were discontinued in Europe. Both LCV and passenger versions continued their career in South America, where they are still produced years after.Passenger vans Berlingo Multispace and Partner Patag&#243;nica received an update in June 2021. More parts of both vehicles are now manufactured locally. It means they now have barn doors (already manufactured locally for LCV Berlingo and Partner), replacing their tailgate that was imported from Europe.The Berlingo and the Partner got a minor facelift in January 2023. The Berlingo adopted an updated Citro&#235;n logo (until there it still used the sharp logo from before 2009) and a new grille, in plastic. The Partner adopted the same grille and lost the piece of chrome around its front logo.",

        "description": "Since the announcement of its revival in 2001, the GT-R kept car fans around the world on edge until it finally debuted in 2007. In the end, the platform turned out to be a dedicated design created from scratch, no longer an evolution model based on the Skyline coupe.The VR38DETT, the most powerful engine in Japanese car history, is a 3.8L twin turbo producing 473 HP. The power is transmitted to the ground through a trans-axle layout drive system, which optimizes the front to rear weight distribution by unifying the transmission with the rear differential. The front wheels are driven by a drive shaft that returns the power output back to the front of the car. The transmission itself is a 6-speed DCT, which allows highly efficient power transfer and quick gear shifts.Carbon composites and aluminum die cast materials are strategically placed, and even the aerodynamic take into account front/rear balance. Using feedback gained from racing technology, everything was focused towards the pursuit of speed. The only thing that does not coincide with going fast is the 4-seater body, but this is a heritage of the GT-R that goes back even further than the 4WD system.This revolutionary supercar had a major effect to the Nissan manufacturing organization as well. By introducing special craftsmanship in what is called the Takumi (artisan/craftsman) line, they maintained a precision production line but kept flexibility in their production structure. This system not only compensates for increases or decreases in production quantity, but also allows the addition of new, anniversary, or limited edition models, and widens the possibilities for the GT-R.The production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show as confirmed, following an on-screen 7:38.54 minute lap time in damp conditions around the N&#252;rburgring Nordschleife was broadcast, beating the benchmark Porsche 911 Turbo&#39;s time of 7:40 minutes. Nissan called it the record for the fastest lap time for a mass-produced car. The car was previewed as &quot;A supercar, for Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime&quot;. In November, 2007, Nissan revealed that the car already had a considerable demand, as more than 3,000 buyers pre-ordered the car in Japan before its official launch. The car was expected to sell around 200 units per month, to maintain exclusivity. Deliveries began on December 6, 2007, in Japan, on July 7, 2008, in North America and in March 2009 in Europe. The first production GT-R was purchased by Nissan&#39;s CEO at the time, Carlos Ghosn. The large disparity in initial marketing between these regional releases was due to Nissan having to build GT-R performance centres where the car was serviced.",

        "description": "In 2005 the American investment professional and car collector Jim Glickenhaus asked Andrea Pininfarina to build a one-off sports car with a retro design as a tribute to great endurance cars of the past, particularly to Ferrari P series. Program Manager for this fascinating challenge was Ing. Paolo Garella (at that time Responsible for Special Projects at Pininfarina). Ferrari P4/5 by Pininfarina thus came to fruition. Following the presentation of the car, Glickenhaus proposed Paolo Garella, who in the meanwhile had become an independent consultant, to produce a second prototype intended for races. With the design and manufacturing contribution of an important name in the racing world, L.M. di Gianetti, the P4/5 Competizione Project was engineered under Paolo Garella's supervision and in 2011, the car, developed from a Ferrari 430 Scuderia and a Ferrari 430 GT2, arrived on the scene showing a vintage automotive spirit combining passion and competence, craftsmanship and industrial culture. Since the very first competitions, the whole P4/5 Competizione team, managed by Scuderia Cameron-Glickenhaus, has been showing a spirit returning authenticity to motor racing, focusing the attention both on the sports challenge itself, but also on sharing, through social networks, this unique experience with fans all over the world.2011 N\u00fcrburgring 24 HoursPrior to the 24 Hours, the P4/5C contested two earlier six-hour races on the N\u00fcrburgring track to give former F1 greats Mika Salo and Nicola Larini, British Touring Car champion Fabrizio Giovanardi, and seasoned N\u00fcrburgring veteran Luca Cappellari a taste of what was to come. During the 24 Hours, the team showed to be determined, one way or another, to finish. When the checkered flag fell in bright sun at 4 p.m. Sunday, the P4/5C had covered 133 laps, finishing to 39th, nearly where it had started. The P4/5C, for its part, finished second in its class, the experimental E1-XP2 category. The N\u00fcrburgring organizers awarded the P4/5C a Constructor's Trophy for entering a new and significant car. Soon after the race, the P4/5 Competizione took a well-earned vacation by a one-month display in Turin's National Automobile Museum. ",

        "description": "When it comes to the creation of the most extreme versions, Zonda R is a clear indication that the Modenese atelier - on a par with the greatest fashion designers - is capable of strengthening its uniqueness without sacrificing driver comfort.The central monocoque in carbon-titanium, more rigid and lighter than ever, encases a Mercedes-Benz AMG V12 high-performance racing engine as if it were a precious gem. This four wheel prodigy is able to deliver 750 HP and produce a torque of 710 Nm. This engine is bolted directly to the central monocoque. A direct throttle actuation via mechanical cable ensures immediate throttle response, thus achieving improved propulsor performance in terms of reactivity.20 milliseconds is the time needed by the Zonda R to perform gearshifts, thanks to a transversal sequential gearbox in magnesium, enhanced by the Xtrac transmission technolgy, Automac Engineering automation and the shift paddles located behind the steering wheel.A power-to-weight ratio of 701 hp-per-ton combined with Pirelli Pzero tyres can catapult the driver from 0 to 100 km/h in less than 2,7 seconds, while the Brembo carbon ceramic brakes ensure the car comes to a standstill even quicker.A dry weight of 1.070 kg is achieved through the AvionAl suspension components, Aspa machined structural ErgAl parts holding the engine and the gearbox, and Poggipolini Titanium screws. Moreover, aerodynamic setups allows for a high downforce setting of up to 1.500kg and a 350kmh top speed setting. The effectiveness of the rear is matched by the complex new front bonnet, as well as the closed flat underbody and rear diffusor.",

The Euro-NASCAR cars are inspired by American NASCAR cars but were built specifically for European tracks. The cars use a V8 engine creating 450 hp. It uses a four-speed manual gearbox, is rear-wheel drive and weighs 1225 kg.A new generation of car, dubbed as the &quot;Next Level&quot; package, was introduced in the 2016 season. The Next Level car saw the introduction of a new aerodynamic package and a redesigned composite body, and the cars adopted an 8-inch rear spoiler instead of the wing used in the previous generation of cars.The first Next Level car to be introduced was the redesigned Chevrolet SS composite body, which was unveiled during the 2015 season-ending race at Circuit Zolder. Resembling the body of its American counterpart, the car made its racing debut in the 2015 Race of Champions. The Ford Mustang body also made its test debut soon after. Starting in 2018, the Chevrolet composite body was updated into a Camaro ZL1-based body style, although the SS body is still legal for competition until the end of the 2019 season. The SS nameplate was subsequently retired in 2020 and existing bodies from the SS platform was rebranded into the EuroNASCAR FJ 2020. The revived Shadow Racing Cars brand would began to compete with their own Shadow DNM8 chassis starting from the 2021 season.NASCAR Whelen Euro Series became the first NASCAR series to introduce sequential gearboxes after it was announced on 25 March 2021 that sequential gearboxes will be made available as an optional choice in 2021, predating NASCAR Cup Series&#39; introduction of the sequential gearboxes with the Next Gen car by one year. A new NASCAR Whelen Euro Series car is available to be purchased from Team FJ at a price of \u20ac89,000 in 2021.Outside of NASCAR Whelen Euro Series competition, the NASCAR Euro Series cars are used in the Race of Champions.NASCAR Whelen Euro Series currently featured Hoosier as the exclusive tyre supplier of the series. Previously, Michelin was the exclusive tyre supplier from the inaugural season in 2009 until 2017 while subsidiary company BFGoodrich became the exclusive tyre supplier for the 2018 season only. In 2019, Continental AG signed a six-year contract to become the exclusive tyre supplier of the series.[28] The deal was renewed on January 22, 2021, extending the tyre supply contract until 2027.

        "description": "Modeled after the 2 Litre Touring Car category introduced in the British Touring Car Championship in 1990, FIA Class 2 was designed to put a stop to the tremendously expensive homologation process and increasingly complex designs seen in Group A. Ironically, despite this conservative attitude, the class would come to be known as &quot;Super Touring&quot;.BMW had entered a two door version of its new E36-generation 3-Series in 1992, badged as a 318iS despite the two liter engine. This was done out of sheer necessity, as the 320i was a six-cylinder car, and BMW wanted to use the ready-made S14 four cylinder engine from the E30 M3, instead of trying to convert the big, long and heavy six into a competitive race motor.The updated 320i picked up right where its predecessor left off, with its S42B20 engine derived from the road M42. The racing version of the M42 engine is called the S42 and was used in BMW&#39;s 320 4-door touring car, participating in the German Super Tourenwagen Cup. Compared with the M42, the S42 has individual throttle bodies, the displacement increased to 1,999 cc (122.0 cu in), two fuel injectors per cylinder, an increased compression ratio and a different cylinder head. The valve cover and airbox were made from carbon fiber and the lubrication system used a dry sump. In 1995, the initial version of the S42 engine produced 224 kW (300 bhp), increasing to 235 kW (315 bhp) for the final version in 1997.",

        "description": "*Note from the authors:Those type of cars usually used very stiff springs that, to maintain a good contact with ground, were coupled with some tender springs. To simulate this in AC, I used the equivalent rate as main spring, that cannot be changed since it has a non influencing variation, and I let you choose the &quot;main&quot; rate with Bumpstops. So change them accordingly to your driving style because they have a quite big impact on handling.Primera adopted 3 ways dampers all around: 2 for BUMP (High and Low speed) and just 1 for REBOUND so you&#39;ll find just 1 rebound bar in setup because High and Low speed are overlayered as their description will. In general you want to increase REBOUND when you increase the relative spring rate or when you want to increase the stability on that corner/axle. Remember that dampers only act on transient so expect some changes on turn in mainly.*The Nissan Primera P11 GT was soon prepared to race starting with JTCC in 1996 till the BTCC in 1998. It was designed by Ray Mallock Limited, and had quite a bit of success in the BTCC between 1998 and 1999. In 1998, David Leslie and Laurent Aiello dominated, winning most of the races in the championship for Nissan, with Aiello being crowned champion. Privately owned Primera, fielded by Matt Neal, won the independent cup in 2000.Under BTCC evolution it had the famous SR20DE engine tuned to peak power around 8500 rpm where there was the limiter for regulations. Much effort was given to the suspension design since in 1999 they couldn&#39;t take the 4WD version to race and so they had to use the rear multi-link beam axle instead of the McPherson. Beside that, within the opponents, the Primera had one of the worst drag coefficient; so, to maintain a good aerodynamic efficiency, in race trim it had one of the less effective rear wing. However a very well shaped front wing assured the car very good handling and stability.",

        "description": "The Clio V6 was based on the Clio Mk II, though it shares very few parts with that car. The 3.0 60&#176; V6 ES9 engine, sourced from the PSA group was upgraded to around 230 PS (169 kW; 227 bhp) and placed in the middle of the vehicle where standard Clios have rear seats \u2013 making this car a two-seater hot hatch.In order to accommodate the radical change from front-engine, front-wheel drive hatchback to mid-engine, rear-wheel drive two-seater quasi-coup&#233;, the car had to be extensively reworked structurally, leading to the Phase 1 version being some 300 kg (660 lb) heavier than the sportiest &quot;regular&quot; Clio, the 172 Cup. Due to this, even though the V6 model had significantly more power, it was not remarkably faster in a straight line accelerating to legal road speeds than the 172 Cup \u2013 accelerating to 60 mph (97 km/h) in 6.2 seconds compared to the Cup&#39;s 6.7 seconds \u2013 though its maximum speed was significantly higher, 146 mph (235 km/h) compared to 138 mph (222 km/h). The raw sound and weight of the V6 engine just behind the driver and RWD made the driving experience very different from the normal front engined front wheel drive car.There were 1,555 production cars built in total between 2001 and 2002.Phase 1 ES9J4 V6 2001-2003 230 PS (227 bhp; 169 kW) 300 N\u22c5m (221 lb\u22c5ft) 2,946 cc (2.9 L; 179.8 cu in)",

        "description": "When the FIA Group B finally took life all the previous Group 4 cars resulted out of date and all manufacturers had to create something new for the homologation in the new rules that allowed much more freedom. Lancia at that time was running with the Stratos that in 1982 was substituted by the 037 Rally. It was very light and agile thus that in the 1983 it won the World Championship, the European and the Italian one.But the Audi was optimizing its revolutionary racing 4WD system so that from the 1984 it was really difficult to compete against it with a simple RWD.Lancia and almost all other manufacturers had to adapt their prototype to 4WD and indeed Lancia and Peugeot focused the target by creating 2 mid engine prototypes that for the rest of the time they lived made a series of battles that shone the heavy nose Audi a bit in shadows.Lancia created the S4 (Sovralimentata, 4WD) that was basically an updated 037 with similar suspensions, a new spaceframe with lighter alloy and composite materials, a new 4WD drivetrain and a new powertrain. Lancia filed many patents for the S4.Some reguarded the AWD system that used a transfer case to asymmetrically split the torque between the two axles while one reguarded the twin charging system that force the air induction with a compressor at mid-low engine speed and with a turbine at higher ones. As soon as the turbine has spooled up, the compressor was pneumatically bypassed, to allow the turbine to operate without thermodynamic efficiency losses typical of the compressor at higher rpms.The first S4 official race was Algrave, Portugal in 31 October 1985 when Lancia hadn&#39;t produced yet the 200 street versions of the car requested to homologate the race one. The FIA anticipated its homologation to allow Lancia to participate to the championship that was starting but no one knows if Lancia has ever produced all the 200 &quot;Stradale&quot; models...By the way, within 1985 and 1986, Lancia and other competitors, working on those and other technical innovations like tires compound and aerodynamic efficiency, raised safety and performance level of rally cars by several points.",

        "description": "1986 was a sort of beautiful but also black year for Lancia and Abarth: on May 2nd, during the Tour de Corse, in Corsica, Henri Toivonen co-driven by Sergio Cresto lost the control of its S4 and both died through the flames.That was one of the reasons why the FIA decided to cancel the Group B, they thought those car too much powerful and uncontrollable.And indeed they were a sort of walking labs in which engineers tried many innovative solutions at every race. The S4 was no less. In 1986 the engine gained some more power and thanks to the new Magneti Marelli ECU IAW 060, introduced during the rally of Argentina, in place of the 040 a sort of push to pass function was made available for the driver. He could increase the wastegate pressure for a limited time during the race.Beside the engine evolution, the S4 lost some kilograms and gained the hydraulic power steering in which, as you should have noticed, the old S4 required some brute muscular force to drive through some 40 km or more stages. The driver found it very useful but admitted that it made the steering wheel to lose some feedback.",

        "description": "When the FIA Group B finally took life all the previous Group 4 cars resulted out of date and all manufacturers had to create something new for the homologation in the new rules that allowed much more freedom. Lancia at that time was running with the Stratos that in 1982 was substituted by the 037 Rally. It was very light and agile thus that in the 1983 it won the World Championship, the European and the Italian one.But the Audi was optimizing its revolutionary racing 4WD system so that from the 1984 it was really difficult to compete against it with a simple RWD.Lancia and almost all other manufacturers had to adapt their prototype to 4WD and indeed Lancia and Peugeot focused the target by creating 2 mid engine prototypes that for the rest of the time they lived made a series of battles that shone the heavy nose Audi a bit in shadows.Lancia created the S4 (Sovralimentata, 4WD) that was basically an updated 037 with similar suspensions, a new spaceframe with lighter alloy and composite materials, a new 4WD drivetrain and a new powertrain. Lancia filed many patents for the S4.Some reguarded the AWD system that used a transfer case to asymmetrically split the torque between the two axles while one reguarded the twin charging system that force the air induction with a compressor at mid-low engine speed and with a turbine at higher ones. As soon as the turbine has spooled up, the compressor was pneumatically bypassed, to allow the turbine to operate without thermodynamic efficiency losses typical of the compressor at higher rpms.The first S4 official race was Algrave, Portugal in 31 October 1985 when Lancia hadn&#39;t produced yet the 200 street versions of the car requested to homologate the race one. The FIA anticipated its homologation to allow Lancia to participate to the championship that was starting but no one knows if Lancia has ever produced all the 200 &quot;Stradale&quot; models...By the way, within 1985 and 1986, Lancia and other competitors, working on those and other technical innovations like tires compound and aerodynamic efficiency, raised safety and performance level of rally cars by several points.",

        "description": "Introduced for the 1987 model year and based on the Porsche 911, the CTR featured an enlarged and highly tuned version of Porsche's 3.2 litre flat-six cylinder engine, lightened body panels, an integrated roll cage (adding chassis stiffness in addition to occupant safety), upgraded suspension and braking systems, a custom-designed transmission, and several unique trim pieces such as polyurethane bumpers, and the use of the fender-mounted oil filter (a Porsche feature for the 1972 MY only) necessitated by relocating the oil tank forward to clear the intercooler on that side.Much attention was given to aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered seam welded and the use of filler panels for the door pillars and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler intake ducts over the rear fenders (later dropped, as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.Developing 469 hp (350 kW) and 408 lb\u00b7ft (553 N\u00b7m) of torque and weighing in it at only 2,530 pounds (1,147 kg), the CTR provided stellar performance, with a 0-60 mph time of around 4 seconds and a top speed in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 km/h). Although a small group of vehicles such as the Ferrari F40 and Porsche 959 were faster to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h), the Yellowbird could outperform all competition when it came to top speed, topping out at 211 miles per hour (340 km/h), a top speed that made it the fastest sports car in the world at the time of its release.The car received its nickname, Yellowbird, during testing by Road & Track magazine, whose staffers noted the contrast created by its yellow paintwork against the overcast skies on the day of their photo shoot.",

Initially, it was a version of the Moskvich-408 car with a more powerful engine. At AZLK, both models were produced in parallel until 1976, and then, after another restyling and modernization, production continued under the index 2140 (2138 \u2013 for the M-408). The Moskvich-412 machines of the Izhevsk plant were modernized according to their own program.Thanks to a reliable, tenacious design, a relatively powerful engine and the talent of the racers, Moskvich-412 performed well in the London\u2014Sydney transcontinental marathon run, the London \u2014Mexico Rally, the Tour of Europe, Golden Sands, Western Safari \u2014 Argungu, the Polish Raid and many others.

        "description": "Brought to you by Spec P71 Racing Serieswww.racespecp71.com===========================What is Spec P71 Racing Series?Spec P71 Racing Series is a time attack style racing series that has driver development in mind! We founded this racing series to provide a cheap, affordable, and reliable way to get new to veteran drivers on track and having fun.How was Spec P71 Racing Series Established?Spec P71 Racing Series was a concept that Brett Madsen, the series\u2019 founder, had in mind long before it ever became a legitimate entity. In 2018, he purchased a 2006 Ford Crown Victoria from a government auction for $1,500.00 and the rest was history. A bunch of track days later, this 4200lb \u201cmiata\u201d has remained as reliable and fun as ever to drive.Of all cars\u2026 why the Ford Crown Victoria?The way we like to describe the Crown Victoria is that it is a big heavy Miata. Great handling, impeccably reliable, and fun to boot. The front suspension is a Short-Long Arm (SLA) Suspension on the 2005+ models, they also came equipped from the factory with a Watts Linkage in the rear, attached to the faithful 8.8\u2033 Ford solid rear axle. The engine is a 4.6L 2v that regularly sees north of 200,000mi. The modular power plant is also relatively cheap to maintain and easy to work on giving you the most bang for your buck with Spec P71 Racing Series! Because these cars are so cheap, can handle very well out of the box, and can take an unbelievable amount of abuse at the track, they make for an amazing vehicle to use in a racing series to bring people more seat time and less problems.",

        "description": "The SSC Ultimate Aero is a mid-engined sports car that was produced by SSC North America (formerly known as Shelby SuperCars) from 2004 until 2013. The SSC Ultimate Aero held the world production car speed record title, according to the Guinness World Records, from 2007 (when it was officially timed at 410 km/h) until the introduction of the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport in 2010. In April 2013, the Guinness World Records temporarily disqualified the Veyron&#39;s record time for a period of five days due to concerns about electronic speed limiting changing the function of the car, but after investigation reinstated the Veyron as the record holder.The SSC Ultimate Aero was not sold with electronic driver aids such as an anti-lock braking system or traction control system, as according to Jerod Shelby (no relations to Carroll Shelby), &quot;Early design philosophy on the car was to make it a driver&#39;s car. I wanted a car that you not only throttled with your right foot but at times you could steer with your right foot and a sensor.In 2009, SSC updated the Ultimate Aero TT, with the new version having an increase in power of 15% over the older model. SSC predicts a top speed of over 430 km/h (267 mph) is possible. In order to prevent the engine from overheating, airflow to the engine has been increased 20% with new carbon fibre louvres. The nose has been redesigned to make the car more aerodynamic, and the interior has been redesigned. The new Aero also has a new AeroBrake system, which is a spoiler which rises up to 200 mm when the brake is pressed. This updated model reached a top speed of 415 km/h (258 mph) in a test, according to SSC.Specifications:Engine: twin-turbocharged 6,300 cc SSC V8Power: 960 kW (1287 hp) @ 6100 rpmTorque: 1,500 N\u22c5m (1,106 lbf\u22c5ft) @ 6100 rpmRedline: 7200 rpmTop speed: 415 km/h (257 mph)Dry weight: 1,250 kgA 2009 SSC Ultimate Aero, albeit with the new prototype SSC Tuatara gearbox fitted, was able to complete six runs of 0-300 km/h (186 mph) from 15.1 to 15.8 seconds, according to SSC&#39;s gear ratio testing results",

In contrast with previous tanks, which were armed with rifled tank guns, the T-62 was the first tank armed with a smoothbore tank gun that could fire APFSDS rounds at higher velocities. While the T-62 became the standard tank in the Soviet arsenal, it did not fully replace the T-55 in export markets due to its higher manufacturing costs and maintenance requirements compared to its predecessor. Although the T-62 was replaced in Russia and the successor states of the Soviet Union, it is still used in some countries and its design features became standardized in subsequent Soviet and Russian mass-produced tanks.",

        "description": "By the end of 1972, the requisite 500 homologation cars, dubbed 911 Carrera RS 2.7, sat outside Zuffenhausen for official inspection. The flat-six engine had been bored from 2.4 to 2.7 liters, requiring a special Nikasil cylinder lining for durability. The car retained the same Bosch mechanical fuel injection system as the 2.4 S, but horsepower increased from 190 to 210, with a notable gain in torque. For the first time in production 911 history, a wider 7.0-inch rear wheel was utilized, and widened fenders allowed even larger wheels to be adequately covered for racing use. Wind-tunnel development brought forth a redesigned front air dam and rear ducktail spoiler. The spoiler reduced rear-end lift by 75 percent and became the car&#39;s signature feature. Thinner gauge glass and steel kept weight down, and the 500 homologation cars were all of lightweight (code M471) specification, meaning limited sound deadening and carpeting; non-reclining front race buckets; and no rear seats, clock, interior armrests, or passenger-side sunvisor.",

The cars were named GTA instead of GT, A standing for Alleggerita, italian for lightweight.  The GTA had aluminium outer body panels instead of steel, magnesium allow wheels, clear plastic side windows and various other lightweight parts, bringing down the dry weight to about 914kg. The engine had extensive modifications and upgrades, delivering up to 205bhp in race trim.Five hundred cars were made for homologation purposes and the cars were very successful, obtaining numerous victories and the title in 1966 with Andrea de Adamich. Different evolutions of the car would go ahead and also win the 1970 championship as well as many races up in the early 70s.This model is \u2018GTAm inspired\u2019, to be competitive with the Escort.

The straight 4 engine derived from the Anglia powerplant was bored out and fitted with a special crankshaft and fed by twin Weber Carburetors. The suspension was modified as well.The result was the almost unbeatable Lotus Cortina scoring many road racing victories at the hands of the greats like Jim Clark.",

The team won the 1971 and 1972 SCCA Trans Am Under 2.5 Liter Championship, with the first considered a major upset. Few race fans thought the little Datsun from Japan could match the pace of the Alfas and BMWs, so its success earned it the reputation as &#39;giant killer&#39; among American racing fans. To this day it remains one of the most recognizable and honored racing cars of all time, and it established Nissan/Datsun as an accomplished performance brand.",

Tom Yeager and Bob Johnson proved a formidable privateer entry, by winning 1966\u2019s 300-miler at Mid-America, backing it up with a strong win in the 400-mile T-A race at Virginia International Raceway. There were two more Mustang wins in Trans-Am\u2019s rookie season, that being the McComb//Brooker combo taking the flag at Green Valley Raceway in Texas, and with Jerry Titus closing out the season with a win at Riverside, with only Tullius\u2019 Dart ruining a Mustang 1-2-3 finish at that 1966 season-ending enduro.",

        "description": "1969 Shelby 2000 GTToyota recognised that success in the USA was vital in establishing the car\u2019s quality on an international level and decided it should be entered in SCCA (Sports Car Club of America) competition to demonstrate its abilities against potential showroom rivals such as the Porsche 911, Lotus Elan and Triumph 250.Initially, Peter Brock, designer of the Cobra Daytona, was to be tasked with the job of preparing the cars, but at the last minute a deal was struck with racing legend Carroll Shelby, Brock\u2019s former boss and the mastermind behind the high-performance versions of the AC Cobra and Ford Mustang.Shelby\u2019s modifications included fitting new low-profile tyres and uprated suspension to lower the ride height by around 60mm. He also increased the straight-six engine\u2019s displacement and fitted a new DOHC cylinder head to unleash around 200bhp, and improved the power-to-weight ratio by removing all unnecessary items from the interior. Even though the Toyota delivered less power than its rival Porsche 911, it still recorded a number of race victories that season.ModificationsFiberglas trunk, Koni adjustable damper kits and adjustable anti roll-bars.EngineThe three cars were delivered as a &quot;competition&quot; model. The 150hp engine is pushed to 200hp by Toyota. But Shelby only saw 190 horses on the test bench. With help from John Dunn, the Shelby tweaked Toyota/ Yamaha 6-cylinder inline engine engine would deliver 205hp at 8000 rpm and 245 Nm.To achieve this result, Shelby had to increase the cubic capacity to 2040cm 3. The cast iron block has been polished and reworked for oil circulation, as are the crankshaft and connecting rods. Special pistons are forged from aluminum and Shelby designs a new oil pan, new camshafts, valves and also changes the flywheel. With all these modifications, the 2000GT could reach 240 km/h!Driven by Scooter Patrick and Dave Jordan, the 2000GT competed in the production class of the SCCA series in 1968. Even though the Toyota had less power that its main rival, the Porsche 911, it still recorded a number of race victories, with Patrick and Jordan finishing the series second and third in the championship respectively.",

        "description": "The Volkswagen New Beetle is a compact car, manufactured by Volkswagen from 1998 to even today. With its production run spanning through 2 decades, it has gone though several facelifts.The New Beetle Cup was a promotion effort by Volkswagen to make the Beetle look cool. It was raced in a Beetle spec series and in the 2000 Millennium Cup.Unlike the original 1999 New Beetle, the Beetle Cup got its engine from the Mk3 Golf. According to some sources 76 examples were built, making the Cup rarer than its later road car counterpart. Despite coming with a stripped out interior, it still weighed a hefty 3000lbs. Good thing, that the 2.8L VR6 had been tuned to output a little over 200bhp.After the Cup had ran its course in 2001, they just disappeared. No one knows, how many still exist today. Some were converted to race in amateur open-spec racing, but the Cup was simply too slow to compete in any real racing series.2001 New Beetle RSi is not the Cup car.",

        "description": "After the success of the Millennium Cup, Volkswagen decided to cram the internals of the to-be R32 into a Beetle. Enter the New Beetle RSi. Essentially being a test bed for the Mk4 R32, it was sure to not disappoint. You would hope so, as it retailed at $80,000 new in 2001. Only 250 were ever produced, sealing its demise as a collectors piece.Because I couldn&#39;t be assed to model the interior cards, just pretend its an amateur race car. Specced to be a club racer for the more advanced driver, it features a fully adjustable platform, sequential transmission and 4MOTION-all wheel drive. Its tuned 3.2l VR6 leaves little to be desired with a peak output of 350 horsepower. All this laid to the ground with some grippier race slicks.",

It was revealed to the public at the 86th 24 Hours of Le Mans, with the Vantage GT3 making its racing debut in the Michelin Aston Martin Racing Le Mans Festival. The new Vantage GT3 and GT4 were derived from the new Aston Martin Vantage GTE.The Vantage GT3 is powered by the same 4.0-litre turbocharged V8 engine as the critically-acclaimed Aston Martin Vantage road car. The engine is optimized by Aston Martin Racing and produces a boost-variable 535bhp and 700 Nm of torque. The car weighs in dry at 1245kg.The Vantage GT3 features a lightweight aluminium chassis, based on the road car, and includes a steel roll-cage, an Xtrac six-speed sequential gearbox, an Alcon motorsport multi-plate clutch, Ohlins four-way adjustable dampers, and Alcon brakes and Bosch Motorsport ABS.The Vantage GT3 remained in development until it was homologated on 1 March, 2019. It replaced Aston Martin\u2019s most successful customer car, the V12 Vantage GT3, which continued to win races seven years after it was first introduced to the market. The V12 Vantage GT3 had been particularly successful in the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup and British GT series.The Vantage GT3 was designed to maintain an optimum performance window for professional drivers to be competitive in, while also allowing inexperienced racers to drive quickly. The popularity of the Vantage GT3\u2019s predecessor was largely due to this balance of accessibility and performance.",

It is the successor to the BMW M6 GT3 and offers BMW M Motorsport teams and drivers all over the world the opportunity to challenge for victories and titles in a GT3 model based on the latest generation of BMW M4. The biggest improvements compared to the BMW M6 GT3 are in three areas: driveability, cost efficiency, and operation. The BMW M4 GT3\u2019s handling and cockpit equipment are more comfortable for amateur drivers, while the car is easier on the tires and offers greater consistency. Far lower lifecycle costs and longer maintenance intervals for the engine and transmission are vital economic factors. The new BMW M4 Competition provides the perfect basis for the new top model from BMW M Motorsport. Its engine was designed from the outset for use at the racetrack, which underlines how road car and race car development always go hand in hand at BMW M GmbH. As well as private outings in top-class racing series around the world and endurance classics, the BMW M4 GT3 also goes up against international GT3 competition in the new GTD-PRO class in the IMSA series.",

It was unveiled at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps ahead of the TotalEnergies 24 Hours of Spa. The 296 GT3 features a 24-valve V-6 like the roadgoing 296GTB but without the accompanying electric motor, to comply with technical regulations. According to Ferrari, the 296 GT3 produces 20 percent more downforce than the previous 488 GT3. The engine is positioned farther forward and lower, in a 120-degree configuration with the turbos inside the V, to lower the center of gravity and improve torsional stiffness compared to the 488 GT3. The car uses an entirely new aluminum frame and has a slightly longer wheelbase than the road car to account for regulatory restrictions. The braking system has also been redesigned for the GT3, now 400 mm for the front. The Ferrari 296 GT3 represents the future of the Prancing Horse in GT racing, a sector that has always seen the closest relationship with customers and the greatest transfer of technology and innovative solutions to production cars.",

The GTD Pro category was introduced into the IMSA WeatherTech Sportscar series this year, allowing professional teams and drivers to compete in GT3 cars. Corvette was the only manufacturer that did not have a GT3 version of its car running in customer hands, so it chose to convert its GTE car to GT3 specification for IMSA before the introduction of the new, ground-up GT3 car in 2024. The conversion from GTE to GT3 specification was not simple, as the fuel, power levels, downforce levels, weight and differential regulations are all different. GM worked with IMSA to bring the C8.R into the right performance windows and agreed on where compromises would need to be made in order to ensure the conversion would make sense from a cost and performance perspective. One major difference between GTE and GT3 cars is the braking system. The GTE class does not allow for ABS, but it is mandatory in GT3 categories. The addition of ABS will be one of the biggest changes between the GTE-spec Corvette C8.R and the GTD Pro variant.",

The unmistakable hexagonal airscoop design and the rear fin are derived from the Hurac&#225;n STO and contribute to a more efficient intake system. The airscoop is connected to a snorkel which optimally channels the airflow directly into the engine, resulting in greater responsiveness to the driver\u2019s demands. The introduction of 10 electronically actuated throttle bodies increases the efficiency of the V10 with titanium valves.The all-carbon-fiber bodywork features a muscular design created in collaboration with Lamborghini\u2019s Centro Stile. The new splitters, diffuser and underbody ensure exceptional aerodynamic load. There are also innovations for the rear wing, with new supports that allow for precise adjustment of the wing itself.The Hurac&#225;n GT3 EVO2 was entirely developed at Sant\u2019Agata Bolognese by Squadra Corse. Lamborghini will begin delivering the Hurac&#225;n GT3 EVO2 in the second half of 2022, and the coupe is scheduled to make its competition debut at the 2023 edition of the grueling Daytona 24 Hours.",

        "description": "Radical Motorsport has unveiled the full specification of its all-new SR3 XXR. Enhancing the proven formula of the SR3, the UK-based motorsport firm has focused on performance, usability and durability while retaining the essence of what makes the SR3 the most successful prototype-style sports racing car in the world.SR3 models currently make up the majority of grids in the 12 Radical Cup championships around the world, with over 1,500 sold to date. Today, the team behind the renowned SR3 has confirmed that it has upgraded the model - and it is now available to order in SR3 XXR guise - to be more thrilling and provide drivers with the power to lap for longer, with more agility and speed.Powering the major change is the all-new engine from in-house Radical Performance Engines (RPE). Delivering 232 bhp from the revised 1500 cc unit, the lightweight SR3 XXR is expected to maintain its impressive power-to-weight ratio exceeding 350 hp per tonne. With the ability to run on biofuel from day one, the use of the Generation 5 engine also makes the SR3 XXR the first Radical that can run on biofuel.Delivering on customer feedback, the SR3 XXR has been modified to be more agile on track, especially in crucial pit lane stages in which saving time, while not being penalised for speeding, is pivotal. With a new pit limiter fitted as standard, the chance of being punished for speeding through the pit lane is eliminated. The LMP-inspired central tail \u2018shark fin\u2019 delivers notable aerodynamic improvement to entry and mid corner stability. The SR3 XXR is also clearly differentiated by its lightweight wheels in a new design alongside high-intensity DRL lights. A carbon fibre splitter and rear diffuser will be offered as an option to improve durability and aerodynamics on track.",

Reliability and consistency prevailed in the end, with Fernando Alonso and Giancarlo Fisichella taking the car to the last win and titles for a V10 powered Formula one car, marking the end of an era. This car also claimed Michelin&#39;s first title since its return in Formula One, winning the title again with Renault 2006 car in the 2006 season, the last for the French tyre maker. The R25 was the first Constructors  Championship winning car since 1991 not to have been designed by either Adrian Newey or Rory Byrne.Over 19 races, it scored 191 points, 8 wins, 15 podiums and was fully out of the points only once in 18 starts (not counting the United States Grand Prix where both Renault drivers, in common with all their fellow Michelin tyre runners, withdrew prior to starting).The R25 was also the last Renault Formula One car to use a 6-speed gearbox before the switch to a mandatory 7-speed gearbox in the following season.",

        "description": "The Ferrari F300 was a Formula One car designed by Rory Byrne for Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro to use in the 1998 season. It was powered by a 3.0 V10 engine and designed around a narrower track as mandated by the FIA in a series of regulation changes for that season.It was a competitive and reliable car, however it was still aerodynamically inferior to the McLaren MP4/13. Despite this, Michael Schumacher battled his way to second place in the world championship. Ferrari also finished as runners-up in the constructors&#39; championship. The car was an excellent base for the dominance which Ferrari would achieve in the following seasons.As with all Formula 1 cars, the F300 was heavily and consistently revised during the 1998 season. At the Argentine Grand Prix, a wider front tyre from Goodyear was introduced which significantly improved the handling of the car. &#39;X-wings&#39; were introduced at the San Marino Grand Prix, but were later banned due to safety reasons. A longer wheelbase version of the car was introduced for the German and Belgian Grands Prix and a new spec engine was also designed for the title-deciding Japanese GP.The most significant upgrade to the car, however, was introduced at the Canadian GP, where it received a new diffuser, new rear body panels, a new delta-shaped front wing and top exiting exhausts, the latter of which improved cooling and aerodynamics of the car which was so effective that many other teams copied the design.",

        "description": "The MP4/13 was the first McLaren car completely designed under the lead of Adrian Newey. The year before, when Newey arrived at the Woking-based team, the design of the MP4/12 was already too advanced for him to have a major influence in it.The car was launched at McLaren&#39;s Woking headquarters on Thursday 5th February 1998 in an interim McLaren orange livery. The definitive grey and red livery was only unveiled at Barcelona on 16 February.1998 was a massive opportunity for the McLaren team as the new FIA regulations stipulated a decrease in car width from 2000 mm to 1800 mm. Immediately during winter testing and at the season opening Australian Grand Prix, it proved that McLaren had interpreted the new rules best. Rather than also shortening the wheelbase, McLaren kept it approximately the same and ended up being around three seconds a lap faster than closest competitor Ferrari.The was however more to the car than the longer wheelbase. As early as the Brazilian GP at Interlagos, Ferrari requested an investigation as it believed the McLaren&#39;s were running an illegal braking system. Ahead of the season though, the new system had been given the green light by the FIA technical team.It emerged that the Italian team was thinking that McLaren was using a mechanical system that links the steering with the brakes. Ferrari argued that the system amounts to four-wheel steering which is banned under Article 10.4.1 of the F1 technical regulations.At the same time, it also became clear that McLaren were using brake energy to generate electrical power that is stored in batteries. This electricity is then used to run auxiliary pumps on the engine to push out an additional 30 to 40 hp for a limited period.At the end of the season, the car was still the best, although the Ferrari was more reliable. McLaren won the constructors&#39; championship with 156 points and H&#228;kkinen won his first drivers&#39; title. In 16 competed races, the drivers enjoyed 12 pole positions, 18 podium finishes, 8 wins for H&#228;kkinen and one for Coulthard.",

        "description": "At that altitude, the air is extremely thin, which has a huge impact on the aero and the cooling. In fact, even the 5,000 or so feet between the start and finish line can have a dramatic effect on a racer\u2019s performance.Thankfully, the Pikes Peak Hill Climb rules and regulations provide a broad range of solutions to meet these challenges. And, as you can plainly see, the Volkswagen team is using every stipulation it can to walk away the victor, creating this absolutely ming-boggling aero package.Indeed, as a racer purpose built for a run at Pikes Peak, every side of the I.D. R was was tweaked and tuned to contend with the lack of atmosphere.\u201cThe entire chassis is designed to generate as much downforce as possible, without causing too much aerodynamic drag,\u201d said Fran&#231;ois-Xavier Demaison, the Technical Director at VW and the I.D.

Its last LMP was of course the early generation Audi R18, and its deal with the German marque meant that it could not build Le Mans cars under its own brand during the whole R8-R10-R15 programme. However with that partnership coming to an amicable end (another Italian firm, YCOM, was responsible for the final generation Audi R18s) Dallara set out to develop an all new design for the new LMP2 technical regulations.",

        "description": "The RS Spyder (Type 9R6) is a racing car designed by Porsche in conjunction with Penske to compete in Le Mans Prototype Class 2 (LMP2) racing. The car takes its name from the legendary 550 Spyder of the 1950s (combined with Porsche&#39;s common &quot;RennSport&quot; (lit.: racing sports) designation). The car marked Porsche&#39;s first return to the top level of sports prototype racing since the firm abandoned its Porsche LMP in 1999.The RS Spyder made its debut in the final event of the 2005 American Le Mans Series (ALMS) at Laguna Seca winning its class. Since then the RS Spyder has won the ALMS LMP2 Championship in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and took class honours at Le Mans in 2008 and 2009. The outright victory at the 2008 12 Hours of Sebring was the first major victory for Porsche in endurance racing for five years and it was also the first time in 24 years that the non-premier class won the 12 Hours of Sebring overall. Regulation changes for the 2011 season rendered the RS Spyder obsolete but the car has left a legacy in the Porsche 918, which uses a development of the Spyder&#39;s engine and the 919 which carried Porsche&#39;s racing program on into the LMP 1 category starting in 2014. The RS Spyder was designed completely in-house by Porsche engineers. The chassis is a rigid carbon fibre monocoque with both the engine and transmission being integral stressed members. The 3.4 litre 90-degree V8 racing engine was designed from scratch as was the six-speed electro-pneumatic sequential gearbox. Braking is via six-piston aluminum monobloc calipers and carbon ceramic discs, mounted on suspension controlled by four-way adjustable spring/damper units activated by pushrods with adjustable torsion-bar springs. The car has a dry weight of 825 kilograms (1,819 lb) in 2010 specification but was initially 750 kilograms (1,650 lb).Since its introduction in 2005 the engine, which initially produced 478 horsepower (356 kW) has been developed and modified to meet the changing regulations of both the ALMS and the ACO. For 2008 the engine developed 503 horsepower (375 kW) using direct fuel injection and 440 horsepower (330 kW) in 2009-spec with air restrictor limitations.",

        "description": "In response to the Suez fuel crisis of the late 1950s, designer Sir Alec Issigonis was asked by BMC chairman Sir Leonard Lord to come up with a revolutionary new small car for the masses: affordable, safe to drive and spacious inside. After two years of work, the Mini was launched on 27th August 1959 to rave reviews from the motoring press. However, despite its low price and advanced design, with a transversely mounted engine and front-wheel drive, the Mini only really caught on in 1961, with the launch of a sports model.John Cooper, the owner of a successful Grand Prix team, quickly saw the potential of the Mini for saloon car racing, and became involved by producing Cooper variants. The space-saving design, with its tiny wheels positioned at all four corners of the car, leant it incredible handling characteristics as well as a sharp turn of speed - especially with a 1275cc engine under the bonnet. It won the Monte Carlo rally three times, and took numerous Touring Car titles on the race track.The Mini Cooper disappeared from the range in 1971 with the introduction of the 1275 GT, but was eventually re-introduced in 1990 with the Cooper RSP Limited Edition, which made it clear to the world that the Mini Cooper was back. Only 1650 were produced, but it didn&#39;t take long for Rover to realise there was huge support for a new generation Cooper.By 1992, the Cooper was a part of the Mini range, now sporting a single-point fuel injection system which brought better economy and performance, and turned the then 33 year old design into a far more useable package. The Mini truly did move with the times.As the end of the 20th Century neared, it was clear that the production life of the Mini was coming to a close. After almost 40 years of production, the design needed one last refresh. By October 1996, the final chapter in its history had begun: the introduction of the twin-point fuel injection models. The MPi (Multi-Point fuel injection) models, as they became known, brought about the most radical changes yet: an airbag and side impact beams, a far more luxurious interior, a range of stylish options and a revised engine. The introduction of the MPi ensured that the Mini remained popular, and its charming good looks and amazing go-kart handling firmly won back the attention of the public. The addition of massive spotlights and wide wheel arches, along with some pretty wild paint schemes, brought the Mini bang up to date. The last example of this iconic car rolled off the production line at the Longbridge factory in Birmingham on 4th October 2000.This model was produced in 1999, making it one of the final twin-point injection cars. It features the optional Sports Pack, which included wider wheels, bulging arch extensions, additional guages and, of course, four driving lights up front. At the time, this was the Mini to have. Unsurprisingly, despite an 800 pound premium over the standard Cooper, many buyers opted for the Sports Pack version - when you see one, you immediately know you&#39;re looking at one of the final Minis manufactured.",
